## How Long Does the Flu Last?

The flu typically lasts 7-10 days. Most people experience fever and body 
aches for 3-4 days, followed by lingering fatigue and cough for another 
3-7 days. However, high-risk individuals like young children, elderly, or 
those with chronic conditions may experience symptoms for two weeks or longer.

### Timeline of Flu Symptoms

**Days 1-3: Acute Phase**
- High fever (100-104°F)
- Severe body aches
- Headache
- Extreme fatigue
- Dry cough begins

**Days 4-7: Recovery Phase**
- Fever subsides
- Body aches decrease
- Cough worsens (becomes productive)
- Fatigue continues

**Days 8-14: Final Recovery**
- Most symptoms resolved
- Lingering fatigue
- Occasional cough
- Gradual return to normal energy

### When to See a Doctor

Seek medical attention if you experience:
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- Chest pain or pressure
- Severe dizziness or confusion
- Fever over 104°F that won't reduce
- Symptoms improve then suddenly worsen
- Dehydration (no urination for 8+ hours)

### How to Recover from the Flu Faster

1. **Rest**: Sleep 8-10 hours per night
2. **Hydrate**: Drink 8-10 glasses of water daily
3. **Use a humidifier**: Helps with cough and congestion
4. **Take over-the-counter medication**: Tylenol or ibuprofen for fever
5. **Eat nutritious foods**: Chicken soup, fruits, vegetables
6. **Avoid spreading**: Stay home for 24 hours after fever breaks

### Flu vs Cold: What's the Difference?

| Symptom | Flu | Cold |
|---------|-----|------|
| **Onset** | Sudden (within hours) | Gradual (over days) |
| **Fever** | Usually high (100-104°F) | Rare, low-grade |
| **Body Aches** | Severe | Mild |
| **Fatigue** | Extreme, lasts weeks | Mild |
| **Duration** | 7-10 days | 7-10 days |

## What is the Difference Between 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi?

The main difference is speed versus range. 5GHz WiFi is faster (up to 1,300 
Mbps) but has shorter range and struggles with walls. 2.4GHz WiFi is slower 
(up to 600 Mbps) but reaches farther and penetrates obstacles better. Use 
5GHz for streaming in the same room as your router, and 2.4GHz for devices 
far away or through multiple walls.

### Detailed Comparison

**2.4GHz WiFi**
- **Speed**: Up to 600 Mbps
- **Range**: Up to 150 feet indoors
- **Penetration**: Excellent through walls and floors
- **Interference**: More crowded (Bluetooth, microwaves, baby monitors use this)
- **Channels**: 11 available (only 3 non-overlapping)
- **Best for**: Smart home devices, devices far from router, older devices

**5GHz WiFi**
- **Speed**: Up to 1,300 Mbps (or higher with WiFi 6)
- **Range**: Up to 50 feet indoors  
- **Penetration**: Poor through obstacles
- **Interference**: Less crowded, cleaner signal
- **Channels**: 23 non-overlapping channels
- **Best for**: 4K streaming, gaming, video calls, devices near router

### Which Should You Use?

**Use 5GHz WiFi for**:
- Streaming 4K video
- Online gaming
- Video conferencing
- Downloading large files
- Devices in the same room as router

**Use 2.4GHz WiFi for**:
- Smart home devices (thermostats, cameras)
- Devices in distant rooms
- Outdoor devices
- Older devices that don't support 5GHz
- Basic web browsing and email

### Can You Use Both?

Yes! Modern dual-band routers support both simultaneously. Most devices 
automatically choose the best band, but you can manually select:

1. Create separate network names (SSIDs) for each band
   - Example: "HomeWiFi-5G" and "HomeWiFi-2.4G"
2. Connect devices accordingly
3. Or enable "band steering" to let router choose automatically

### How to Check Which Band You're Connected To

**On iPhone**:
Settings → WiFi → Tap (i) next to network name → Look for channel

**On Android**:
Settings → WiFi → Tap connected network → Advanced → Look for frequency

**On Windows**:
Command Prompt → Type "netsh wlan show interfaces" → Look for radio type

**On Mac**:
Option + Click WiFi icon → Shows band and channel
```
