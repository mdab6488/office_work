### How Voice Search Works

Voice search technology converts spoken queries into text and retrieves relevant results using a multi-step process:

#### The Voice Search Process

```
User Speaks → Speech Recognition → Natural Language Processing → 
Search Algorithm → Results Selection → Voice Response
```

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Audio Capture**: The device's microphone captures your voice
2. **Speech-to-Text**: AI converts audio waves into text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
3. **Natural Language Understanding**: The system interprets intent, context, and meaning
4. **Query Processing**: The search engine processes the query
5. **Result Selection**: Algorithms select the most relevant answer
6. **Text-to-Speech**: The response is converted back to audio (if needed)

**Real-Life Example:**

```
User says: "Hey Google, what's the best Italian restaurant near me?"

Behind the scenes:
1. Google captures: "what's the best italian restaurant near me"
2. Interprets: User wants LOCAL restaurant recommendations
3. Factors considered:
   - User's GPS location
   - Time of day
   - Restaurant ratings
   - Open/closed status
   - Distance
4. Responds: "The highest-rated Italian restaurant near you is 
   Bella Notte, 0.5 miles away, open until 10 PM with 4.8 stars"
```
