  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions About Plumbing Services</h1>

  <!-- Question 1 with Schema Markup -->
  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">How much does it cost to fix a leaky faucet?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>Fixing a leaky faucet typically costs between $150 and $350, depending 
        on the type of faucet and complexity of the repair. A simple washer 
        replacement might cost $150-$200, while fixing a more complex single-handle 
        faucet could cost $250-$350. Emergency service or weekend repairs may cost 
        20-50% more.</p>

  <!-- Question 2 -->
  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">What should I do if my toilet keeps running?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>If your toilet keeps running, first check the flapper valve inside the 
        tank. Lift the lid and see if the rubber flapper is sealing properly. If 
        it's worn or damaged, you can replace it yourself for $10-$20. If the 
        flapper looks fine, the issue might be with the fill valve or float, which 
        may require a plumber. A running toilet can waste up to 200 gallons of 
        water per day, so address it quickly.</p>

  <!-- Question 4 -->
  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">How often should I have my water heater serviced?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        <p>You should have your water heater serviced once a year. Annual 
        maintenance includes flushing the tank to remove sediment buildup, 
        checking the anode rod, testing the pressure relief valve, and inspecting 
        for leaks or corrosion. Regular maintenance extends your water heater's 
        lifespan from 8-12 years to potentially 15+ years and prevents unexpected 
        breakdowns.</p>
