### Follow-Up Strategies

#### **The Follow-Up Timeline**

**Real-Life Campaign Example:**

You sent 50 outreach emails for broken link replacement.

**Day 0: Initial Outreach**
```
50 emails sent
Response rate goal: 20% (10 responses)
```

**Day 3: First Follow-Up**
```
To: 35 people who didn't respond
Subject: Re: Found a broken link on [Article]

Hi [Name],

Just bumping this up in your inbox—wanted to make sure you saw my 
email about the broken link on your [Article] page.

[Screenshot of broken link]

Quick recap: I found the [Specific Link] is returning a 404, and I 
have a similar resource that might work as a replacement if you're 
updating the page.

No pressure either way!

```

**Day 7: Second Follow-Up (Different Angle)**
```
To: 20 people who still haven't responded
Subject: Re: Found a broken link on [Article]

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm assuming you're swamped (totally get it!).

Quick question: Is this the right email to reach you about content updates? 
Or should I contact someone else on your team?

If the broken link isn't a priority, no worries—just wanted to make sure 
this got to the right person.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Day 14: Final Follow-Up (Value-Add)**
```
To: 10 people who still haven't responded
Subject: Last note on [Article] + bonus resource

Hi [Name],

This is my last email—don't want to be a pest!

Beyond the broken link, I noticed your article is from 2021. I put together 
a list of 5 updated resources on [Topic] that might be helpful if you're 
ever refreshing the content:

1. [Resource]
2. [Resource]
3. [Resource]
4. [Resource]
5. [Resource]

Feel free to use any/all of these. Hope they help!

Best,

#### **The "Breakup Email" Strategy**

**When to Use:** After 3-4 follow-ups with no response

**Real Example:**

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi Jennifer,

I've reached out a few times about the resource page addition for 
runnersworld.com/training-resources. I haven't heard back, which 
usually means one of three things:

1. You're not interested (totally fine!)
2. Wrong timing (I get it)
3. My emails aren't reaching you (technical issue)

Would it be helpful if I:
→ Closed your file and stopped following up?
→ Checked back in 3 months?
→ Sent this to someone else on your team?

Just let me know—appreciate either way!

Best,
Mike
```

**Why This Works:**
- Creates urgency ("I'm about to give up")
- Offers clear options (low friction)
- Shows respect for their time
- Often triggers response (even if it's "not interested")

**Actual Response Rate:** 40% of "breakup emails" get responses

#### **The "Check-In" Follow-Up**

**Use Case:** They said "yes" but haven't implemented yet

**Timeline:** 2 weeks after approval

```
Subject: Re: Adding FitLifeDaily to your resources page

Hi Jennifer,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to check in on the resource addition 
we discussed a couple weeks ago.

I know updates can take time (especially with site freezes, approval 
processes, etc.). Just wanted to see if:
- You need any additional info from me
- There's a timeline I should expect
- I should follow up with someone else

No rush—just staying organized on my end!

Thanks,
Mike
