Subject: Quick suggestion for your marathon training resources

Hi Jennifer,

I was researching marathon training plans and came across your resource 
page at runnersworld.com/training-resources. Really helpful compilation—
I've bookmarked it for my clients!

I noticed you included Hal Higdon and Jeff Galloway's programs. I thought 
you might be interested in our Marathon Pace Calculator:

https://fitlifedaily.com/marathon-pace-calculator

It's a free tool that includes:
• Custom pace charts for any goal time
• Elevation adjustment algorithms
• Weather impact calculations

Runner's World (UK) featured it in their "Best Running Tools 2024" article, 
and it's used by 15,000+ runners monthly.

Would it be a good fit for your resources page? Either way, keep up the 
great work on the training content!

Best,

#### Template 2: **Broken Link Replacement**

Hi [Name],

I was reading your article "[Article Title]" and found it super helpful 
for [reason]. However, I noticed one of your links seems to be broken:

[Screenshot or description of broken link]

I recently published something similar that might work as a replacement:
[Your URL]

It covers [similar topics] and includes [unique value proposition].

No worries if it's not a fit—just wanted to give you a heads up about 
the broken link either way!

Thanks,

**Real Example:**

```
Subject: Found a broken link on "15 Best Nutrition Apps"

Hi Sarah,

I was reading your article "15 Best Nutrition Apps for Weight Loss" and 
found it super helpful for my meal planning. However, I noticed the link 
to CalorieKing (position #8) now redirects to a 404 page.

[Screenshot attached]

I recently published a comprehensive review of nutrition tracking apps 
that might work as a replacement:

https://fitlifedaily.com/nutrition-app-comparison

It covers 20 apps with detailed pros/cons and includes a comparison 
chart that readers can download.

No worries if it's not a fit—just wanted to give you a heads up about 
the broken link either way!

Thanks,
Mike

#### Template 3: **Guest Post Pitch**

```
Subject: Guest post idea: [Specific Title]

Hi [Name],

I've been following [Their Blog] for a while and loved your recent piece 
on [Recent Article]. The section about [Specific Detail] was particularly 
insightful.

I have an idea for a guest post that I think would resonate with your 
audience:

"[Specific Title]"

The article would cover:
• [Specific Point 1 with unique angle]
• [Specific Point 2 with unique angle]
• [Specific Point 3 with unique angle]

I'd include [Original Research/Data/Case Study] from my work with 
[Credibility Factor].

For reference, here are some pieces I've written:
• [Article 1] - Published on [Site] (X shares)
• [Article 2] - Published on [Site] (Y comments)
• [Article 3] - Published on [Site] (Featured by Z)

Would this be a good fit for [Their Blog]?

Subject: Guest post idea: "Why 80% of Beginners Quit HIIT (And How to Fix It)"

Hi Amanda,

I've been following NerdFitness for a while and loved your recent piece 
on "Making Exercise Sustainable." The section about progressive overload 
for beginners was particularly insightful.

I have an idea for a guest post that I think would resonate with your 
audience:

"Why 80% of Beginners Quit HIIT Within 30 Days (And the 5-Step Protocol 
to Fix It)"

The article would cover:
• The metabolic adaptation trap that causes burnout
• Why intensity intervals need to be personalized (not "one-size-fits-all")
• A progressive 8-week protocol I developed and tested with 300+ clients
• Recovery metrics that predict dropout (with simple tracking methods)

I'd include original data from my 12-month study tracking 300 beginners 
through HIIT programs, showing 82% success rate with modified protocols 
vs. 23% with standard programs.

For reference, here are some pieces I've written:
• "Strength Training Mistakes" - Published on BarBend (2,400 shares)
• "Recovery Science" - Published on Breaking Muscle (180 comments)
• "Beginner Programming" - Featured by T-Nation

Would this be a good fit for NerdFitness?

#### Template 4: **Content Collaboration**

```
Subject: Collaboration idea for [Topic]

Hi [Name],

I came across your [Platform - podcast/YouTube channel/blog] while 
researching [Topic], and I'm impressed by [Specific Compliment].

I'm working on [Your Project] and thought there might be a collaboration 
opportunity that would provide value to both our audiences:

OPTION 1: [Specific collaboration idea]
OPTION 2: [Alternative collaboration idea]

My audience of [X followers/subscribers] on [Platform] would love 
[Their Content], and I think your audience would benefit from 
[Your Unique Value].

Would you be open to a quick call to explore this?

Best,
[Your Name]
