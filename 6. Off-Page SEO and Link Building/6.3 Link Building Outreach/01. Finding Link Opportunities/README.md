### Finding Link Opportunities

#### 1. **Competitor Backlink Analysis**

**Real-Life Example:**
Let's say you run a fitness blog called "FitLifeDaily.com". You want to find where your competitors are getting their links.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

```
1. Identify your top 3-5 competitors
   - Competitor 1: bodybuilding.com
   - Competitor 2: nerdfitness.com
   - Competitor 3: fitnessblog.com

2. Use SEO tools to analyze their backlinks:
   - Ahrefs: Site Explorer → Enter competitor domain
   - SEMrush: Backlink Analytics → Competitor URL
   - Moz: Link Explorer → Competitor analysis

3. Filter for high-quality opportunities:
   - Domain Authority > 30
   - Organic Traffic > 1,000/month
   - Dofollow links only
   - Relevant to fitness niche
```

**Example Output:**

| Linking Domain | DR/DA | Link Type | Context |
|---------------|-------|-----------|---------|
| healthline.com | 92 | Resource page | "Best fitness blogs" |
| menshealth.com | 87 | Guest post | Author bio link |
| reddit.com/r/fitness | 91 | Community mention | Helpful resource |
| verywellfit.com | 85 | Content reference | Diet article citation |

**Actionable Insight:** If Healthline links to 3 of your competitors but not you, that's a prime opportunity. They clearly link to fitness resources, and you should be on their radar.

#### 2. **Resource Page Link Building**

**What are Resource Pages?**
Pages specifically created to list helpful resources, tools, or links on a particular topic.

**Real-Life Example:**

**Finding Resource Pages:**

```
Google Search Operators:
- "fitness" + "resources"
- "nutrition" + "helpful links"
- "workout" + "recommended sites"
- intitle:"resources" + "health"
- "personal training" + inurl:links
- "best fitness websites" + blogroll
```

**Example Discovery:**

You find: www.universityfitnesscenter.edu/student-resources/fitness-links

**The page lists:**
- 25 fitness websites
- 10 nutrition calculators
- 15 workout planning tools
- Your competitor is listed, but you're not

**Your Pitch:**
"Your resource page is missing a comprehensive meal planning tool that 50,000+ students use monthly."

---

#### 3. **Broken Link Building**

**Real-Life Scenario:**

You discover that Shape.com has an article "10 Best Meal Prep Apps" from 2020. One of the apps (let's call it "MealPlanPro") shut down, creating a 404 error.

**Your Opportunity:**

```
Broken Link: shape.com/article/meal-prep-apps → Links to MealPlanPro.com (404)
Your Solution: You have a similar (or better) meal prep tool
Your Pitch: "Hey, I noticed the link is broken. Here's a working alternative."
```

**Tools to Find Broken Links:**
- Ahrefs Site Explorer → Broken Backlinks
- Check My Links (Chrome Extension)
- Dead Link Checker
- Screaming Frog SEO Spider

**Example Process:**

```
1. Find authority site in your niche: womenshealthmag.com
2. Run broken link checker on their resource pages
3. Find 404 errors: 15 broken links on their fitness tools page
4. Match broken links to your content
5. Create outreach campaign
```

#### 4. **HARO (Help A Reporter Out)**

**Real-Life Example:**

You receive this HARO query:

```
QUERY: Seeking fitness experts for article on "Home Workout Trends Post-Pandemic"
OUTLET: Forbes.com
DEADLINE: 24 hours
REQUIREMENTS: Certified trainers with 5+ years experience
```

**Your Response Strategy:**

```
