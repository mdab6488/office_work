### Relationship Building

#### **The Long Game: Building Real Relationships**

**Real-Life Case Study:**

**Background:**
Sarah runs "TechStartupTools.com" - a resource site for startup founders. She wanted links from major tech blogs but had no existing relationships.

**Month 1-2: Engagement Phase**

```
Actions Taken:
✓ Followed target blogs on Twitter
✓ Commented thoughtfully on 3-5 articles per week
✓ Shared their content with added insights
✓ Engaged in industry discussions on LinkedIn
✓ No asks, just genuine engagement
```

**Example Engagement:**

```
On TechCrunch Article About SaaS Pricing:

Sarah's Comment:
"Really solid breakdown of value-based pricing. One addition: we found 
that showing 'cost per user per day' (instead of monthly) reduced sticker 
shock by 43% for enterprise clients. Framing $300/month as '$2 per day 
per team member' made the psychology completely different."

[This adds value, shows expertise, starts conversation]
```

**Month 3-4: Value-First Outreach**

```
Sarah's Email to TechCrunch Writer:

"Hi Jason,

I've been following your SaaS pricing series—really valuable content. 

I recently completed a study of 150 startup pricing pages and found 
something surprising: 78% don't explain ROI until page 3+ of the website, 
yet conversion rates double when ROI is above the fold.

I compiled the data into a report. Would you be interested in the raw 
data for a potential article? No attribution needed—just thought it 
might be useful for your research.

Best,
Sarah"
```

**Result:**
- Jason used the data in his next article
- Cited Sarah's site as source
- Opened relationship for future collaborations
- 3 more links over next 6 months through natural relationship

**Real Example:**

```
Target: Fitness influencer with 50K followers who regularly links to resources

Week 1-2:
- Follow and turn on notifications
- Like and retweet valuable content

Week 3-4:
- Quote retweet with additional insights
- Tag them in relevant discussions
- Create content that expands on their ideas

Example Tweet:
"Building on @FitnessGuru's excellent thread about progressive overload 🧵

Here's what the research shows about tempo training:
- Eccentric focus: +23% strength gains
- Concentric focus: +18% power output
- Both: Depends on goal

Quick breakdown: [1/5]"

Week 5+:

#### **LinkedIn Relationship Strategy**

**Real-Life Example:**

**Target:** CMO at major SaaS company who regularly shares marketing insights

```
Month 1: Observation
- Follow and engage with posts
- Study their content themes
- Note what gets most engagement

Month 2: Value Engagement
- Comment with data-backed insights
- Share their posts with thoughtful commentary
- Connect with their network thoughtfully

Example Comment:
"Your point about CAC payback period is critical. We reduced ours 
from 18 to 7 months by segmenting leads by 'product awareness stage' 
instead of traditional demographics. Completely changed our nurture 
sequences. Would love to share the framework if useful."

Month 3: Connection Request
"Hi [Name], I've been following your insights on B2B marketing and 
consistently learn something new. Would love to connect and continue 
the conversation. [Specific reference to their recent post]."

Month 4: Natural Ask
After months of genuine engagement, the ask becomes natural:
"We're publishing a comprehensive guide on reducing CAC—would you be 
willing to contribute a quote about your experience? Happy to link 
to your company/content."
