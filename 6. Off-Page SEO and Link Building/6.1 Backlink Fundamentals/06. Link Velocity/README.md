### Link Velocity

**Definition:** Link velocity is the rate at which your website acquires new backlinks over time. It measures how quickly you're building links.

**Natural vs. Unnatural Velocity:**

**Natural Link Velocity Pattern:**
```
Month 1: 5 new backlinks
Month 2: 8 new backlinks
Month 3: 12 new backlinks
Month 4: 10 new backlinks
Month 5: 15 new backlinks

This gradual, somewhat irregular growth looks natural 
to Google's algorithms.
```

**Unnatural Link Velocity Pattern (Red Flag):**
```
Month 1: 3 new backlinks
Month 2: 2 new backlinks
Month 3: 500 new backlinks (SUSPICIOUS!)
Month 4: 550 new backlinks
Month 5: 1 new backlink

This sudden spike triggers spam detection algorithms.
```

**Real-Life Examples:**

```
EXAMPLE 1: Natural Link Velocity ✅

A small business blog publishes quality content:
- Week 1: Publish article → 2 organic shares
- Week 2: Reddit discovers it → 5 more links
- Week 3: Industry blog mentions it → 3 links
- Month 2: Gradually gets picked up → 10 more links
- Month 3: Becomes reference material → 12 links

Total: 32 links over 3 months (natural curve)

EXAMPLE 2: Unnatural Link Velocity ❌

A website uses a link farm service:
- Monday: Website has 50 backlinks
- Tuesday: Buys 1,000 links from link farm
- Wednesday: Google notices sudden spike
- Next week: Website penalized, rankings drop

This artificial spike is easily detected and penalized.
```

**Real Case Study:**

```
JCPenney Penalty (2011):

What happened:
- JCPenney acquired thousands of low-quality links very quickly
- Link velocity was unnaturally high and suspicious
- Google manually penalized them
- Rankings plummeted for 3 months

Outcome:
- Lost 50+ positions for key terms like "dresses"
- Had to disavow thousands of links
- Took 6 months to partially recover
```

**Ideal Link Velocity Guidelines:**

```
NEW WEBSITE (0-6 months):
Target: 5-15 quality links per month
Why: New sites naturally grow slowly

ESTABLISHED SITE (1-3 years):
Target: 10-30 quality links per month
Why: More content to naturally attract links

AUTHORITY SITE (3+ years):
Target: 20-100+ links per month
Why: Large content library naturally attracts consistent links
```

**Red Flags Google Looks For:**

1. **Sudden Spikes:**
   - 10 links → 500 links → 10 links (suspicious)

2. **All Links at Once:**
   - 300 links on same day from same network

3. **Decreasing Quality Over Time:**
   - Started with DA 70 sites, now getting DA 10 sites

4. **Link Bursts After Algorithm Updates:**
   - Trying to quickly recover from penalties
