### Link Authority

**Definition:** Link authority refers to the strength and trustworthiness of the domain passing the link. It's measured by various metrics that indicate how powerful a linking domain is.

**Common Authority Metrics:**

1. **Domain Authority (DA)** - Moz's metric (0-100 scale)
2. **Domain Rating (DR)** - Ahrefs' metric (0-100 scale)
3. **Trust Flow** - Majestic's metric
4. **Page Authority** - Authority of specific page

**Real-Life Examples:**

```
VERY HIGH AUTHORITY LINKS (DA 90+):
✅ Harvard.edu - DA 96
✅ BBC.co.uk - DA 95
✅ Wikipedia.org - DA 94
✅ Forbes.com - DA 94

HIGH AUTHORITY LINKS (DA 70-89):
✅ Shopify.com - DA 87
✅ Mailchimp.com - DA 86
✅ Canva.com - DA 82

MEDIUM AUTHORITY LINKS (DA 40-69):
✅ Industry-specific blogs
✅ Established niche sites
✅ Regional news sites

LOW AUTHORITY LINKS (DA 0-39):
✅ New websites
✅ Personal blogs
✅ Small local businesses
```

**Real Example Scenario:**

```
Two SaaS Companies Get Different Links:

Company A (Gets Low Authority Link):
- Link from: SmallTechBlog.com (DA 22, 2-year-old site)
- Result: Minimal ranking improvement

Company B (Gets High Authority Link):
- Link from: TechCrunch.com (DA 93)
- Result: Significant ranking boost, 300% traffic increase

The TechCrunch link is worth approximately 100x more in 
SEO value, plus brings massive referral traffic.
```

**Quality Over Quantity:**

```
Scenario: Two Websites After 6 Months

Website A:
- 500 links from DA 10-20 sites
- Poor quality, spammy sources
- Rankings: Improved minimally or penalized

Website B:
- 10 links from DA 60-80 sites
- High quality, relevant sources
- Rankings: Jumped to page 1 for target keywords

Lesson: 10 high-authority links beat 500 low-quality links
```

**Real Case Study:**
Brian Dean (Backlinko) increased organic traffic by 110% in 14 days by acquiring just ONE high-authority backlink from a DA 91 website (Forbes).
