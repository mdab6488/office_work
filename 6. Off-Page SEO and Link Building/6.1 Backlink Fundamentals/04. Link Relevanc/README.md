### Link Relevance

**Definition:** Link relevance measures how closely related the linking site's content is to your site's content. Relevant links are significantly more valuable than irrelevant ones.

**Real-Life Example:**

```
HIGH RELEVANCE ✅
Scenario: You run a vegan recipe blog

Relevant Link: 
Healthline.com (health/nutrition site) links to your 
"High-Protein Vegan Meals" article from their guide on 
plant-based nutrition.

Why it's valuable:
- Same niche (health/food/nutrition)
- Same target audience (health-conscious individuals)
- Contextually relevant content
- Strong topical authority match

LOW RELEVANCE ❌
Irrelevant Link:
A car mechanic blog links to your vegan recipe site from 
an article about engine oil.

Why it's less valuable:
- Completely different niches
- Different audience
- No contextual relevance
- Seems unnatural/spammy
```

**Real Industry Example:**

```
Moz (SEO Software Company):

HIGH RELEVANCE LINKS:
✅ Search Engine Journal (SEO news)
✅ Neil Patel's Blog (Digital Marketing)
✅ HubSpot Marketing Blog (Marketing)
✅ Ahrefs Blog (SEO tools)

LOW RELEVANCE LINKS:
❌ A fishing equipment store
❌ A local pizza restaurant blog
❌ A fashion designer portfolio

Even if the low-relevance sites have high authority, 
the links provide less SEO value because there's no 
topical connection.
```

**Levels of Relevance:**

1. **Exact Match Relevance** (Best)
   - Same narrow topic
   - Example: Link from "WordPress Security Blog" to your "WordPress Security Plugin"

2. **Topical Relevance** (Good)
   - Same broader industry
   - Example: Link from "Web Development Blog" to your "WordPress Plugin"

3. **Loose Relevance** (Okay)
   - Related industry
   - Example: Link from "Small Business Blog" to your "WordPress Plugin"

4. **No Relevance** (Minimal value)
   - Unrelated industry
   - Example: Link from "Fishing Blog" to your "WordPress Plugin"
