### Link Equity (Link Juice)

**Definition:** Link equity is the value and authority passed from one website to another through hyperlinks. Think of it as "SEO power" flowing through links.

**How It Works:**
1. High-authority sites have more link equity to pass
2. This equity flows through links to other pages
3. The receiving page gains ranking power

**Real-Life Example:**

```
Scenario: A Tech Startup's Link Equity Journey

Page A: TechCrunch.com (Domain Authority: 93/100)
         ↓ (passes significant link equity)
Page B: YourStartup.com/product
         ↓ (passes some link equity)
Page C: YourStartup.com/blog/post-1

When TechCrunch links to your product page, it passes valuable 
link equity. Your product page then passes some of that equity 
to your blog post through internal linking.
```

**Factors Affecting Link Equity:**

1. **Source Authority:**
   - Link from CNN.com = High equity
   - Link from new-random-blog.com = Low equity

2. **Number of Outbound Links:**
   - Page with 5 links = Each link gets ~20% of equity
   - Page with 100 links = Each link gets ~1% of equity

3. **Link Position:**
   - Links in main content = More equity
   - Links in footer/sidebar = Less equity

**Real Example:**
When Wikipedia links to your site, the link equity is diluted because Wikipedia pages often have 50+ outbound links. However, a contextual link from a focused blog post with only 3-5 outbound links passes more concentrated equity.
