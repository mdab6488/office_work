### What are Backlinks

**Definition:** Backlinks (also called "inbound links" or "incoming links") are hyperlinks from one website to another. They act as "votes of confidence" from one site to another, signaling to search engines that your content is valuable, credible, and useful.

**Real-Life Example:**
```
The New York Times writes an article about climate change and links to 
a research study published on NASA's website:

"According to recent data from NASA [link], global temperatures have 
risen by 1.1°C since pre-industrial times."

This creates a backlink: NYTimes.com → NASA.gov
```

**Why They Matter:**
- Search engines use backlinks as a primary ranking factor
- They drive referral traffic to your website
- They increase domain authority and trustworthiness
- They help search engines discover new pages

**Real-World Impact:**
When Backlinko (SEO blog) analyzed 1 million Google search results, they found that the number one result in Google has an average of 3.8x more backlinks than positions #2-#10.
