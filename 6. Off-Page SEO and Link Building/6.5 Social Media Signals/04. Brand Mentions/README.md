### 6.5.4 Brand Mentions

#### What Are Brand Mentions?

Brand mentions occur when your company, product, or website is referenced online, with or without a hyperlink.

#### Types of Brand Mentions

**1. Linked Mentions**
```
Example: "According to a study by Ahrefs, backlinks remain..."
```

**2. Unlinked Mentions**
```
Example: "I used SEMrush to analyze my competitors and found..."
```

**3. Social Mentions**
```
Tweet: "Just tried @Grammarly and it's amazing for editing!"
```

#### Why Brand Mentions Matter for SEO

**Google's Understanding:**
Google uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand brand mentions as trust signals, even without links. This is part of the E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) evaluation.

**Real-Life Example:**
Apple's SEO advantage:
- Mentioned millions of times daily without links
- "iPhone review," "MacBook specs," "Apple Watch features"
- Google associates Apple with tech authority
- Result: Apple ranks #1 for broad terms like "laptop" and "smartphone"
