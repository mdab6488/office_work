I saw your article on flexible dieting and thought your readers might

[Your Calculator URL]

It's a free macro calculator that accounts for activity level, goals, 
and even has presets for different diet styles (keto, high carb, etc.).

Unlike most calculators, it shows week-by-week projections and adjusts 
for metabolic adaptation.

Free to use and embed if you think it would help your audience!

Best,
[Name]"

Week 4-6: Outreach Phase 2
Target: Forums and communities (Reddit, Facebook groups)

Approach: Answer questions naturally, mention tool when relevant

Example Reddit Comment:
"The calculator at [URL] accounts for activity level. I use it with my 
clients and it's pretty accurate. Free to use."

Week 7-8: Guest Post Campaign
Target: Authority fitness sites

Pitch: "How to Calculate Macros for [Specific Goal]: A Science-Based Guide"

```
