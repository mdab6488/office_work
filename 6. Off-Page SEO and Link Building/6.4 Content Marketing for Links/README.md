### **Common Link Building Mistakes to Avoid**

**Mistake #1: Buying Links**

```
❌ DON'T: "I'll pay you $100 for a link"
✓ DO: "I created this resource that might be valuable for your readers"

Why: Google penalizes paid links. Can destroy your rankings.
```

**Mistake #2: Generic Outreach**

```
❌ DON'T:
"Hi, would you link to my website? Thanks!"

✓ DO:
"Hi Jennifer, loved your article on marathon training. I noticed you 
mentioned [specific detail]. I thought this calculator might add value 
for your readers who are planning their race pace..."

Why: Generic emails get 3% response rate. Personalized get 30%.
```

**Mistake #3: Ignoring Broken Links**

```
❌ DON'T: Give up after first outreach

✓ DO: 
- Follow up 3-4 times
- Provide easy copy-paste replacement
- Offer to help with implementation

Why: 70% of links come after follow-ups.
```

**Mistake #4: Creating Content Nobody Wants to Link To**

```
❌ DON'T: "Top 10 List" (everyone has one)

✓ DO: Original research, tools, data, unique insights

Why: Linkable assets earn 67% more links than standard blog posts.
```

**Mistake #5: No Promotion Plan**

```
❌ DON'T: "Build it and they will come"

✓ DO:
- Outreach list ready before launch
- Email sequence prepared
- Social promotion scheduled
- Paid promotion budget allocated

Why: Even great content needs promotion to earn links.

## Final Thoughts

Link building is a long-term strategy. Don't expect overnight results. The best approach:

1. **Create genuinely valuable content** that deserves links
2. **Build real relationships** with people in your industry
3. **Be persistent** with follow-ups (but not annoying)
4. **Track everything** and optimize based on data
5. **Stay patient** - good links compound over time

**Remember:** One link from a DR 80 site is worth more than 100 links from DR 20 sites. Focus on quality over quantity.
