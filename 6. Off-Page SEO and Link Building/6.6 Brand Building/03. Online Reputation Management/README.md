### 6.6.3 Online Reputation Management

#### What Is Online Reputation Management (ORM)?

ORM involves monitoring, influencing, and managing your brand's online presence and perception across all digital channels.

#### Why ORM Matters for SEO

**1. Search Results Perception**
When someone searches your brand name, the first page results shape their perception:
- Positive: Reviews, awards, press coverage
- Negative: Complaints, lawsuits, scandals

**2. Rich Snippet Impact**
```
Brand Search: "XYZ Company"

Good Result:
★★★★★ 4.8 stars (1,234 reviews)
"Award-winning service provider..."

Bad Result:
★★☆☆☆ 2.1 stars (856 reviews)
"Customer complaints about..."
```

**3. Conversion Impact**
- Positive online reputation: 70% conversion rate
- Negative online reputation: 5% conversion rate

#### Monitoring Your Online Reputation

**Tools to Use:**

**1. Google Alerts**
```
Setup:
Alert 1: "Your Brand Name"
Alert 2: "Your Brand Name" + "review"
Alert 3: "Your Brand Name" + "scam"
Alert 4: "Your Brand Name" + "complaint"
Alert 5: CEO name + "Your Brand Name"
```

**2. ReviewTrackers**
- Aggregates reviews from 100+ sites
- Sentiment analysis
- Competitive comparison

**3. Brandwatch**
- Social listening
- Trend identification
- Crisis detection

**Real-Life Example: United Airlines Crisis (2017)**
```
Incident: Passenger forcibly removed from flight
- Video went viral (100M+ views)
- "United Airlines" searches spiked 1,000%
- Stock dropped $1.4 billion in value

Poor Response:
- CEO initially defended actions
- Took 24 hours to apologize
- Reputation damage lasted months

Lesson: Real-time monitoring + immediate response crucial
```

#### Managing Negative Content

**Strategy 1: Respond Professionally**

**Template for Negative Reviews:**
```markdown
Public Response to Negative Review:

"Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. We're sorry to hear about your experience with [specific issue].

This isn't the level of service we strive to provide. We'd like to make this right.

Could you please email us at [email] or call [phone] with your order details? We'll prioritize resolving this for you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Title], [Company]"

Why This Works:
✓ Acknowledges the issue publicly
✓ Shows you care
✓ Takes conversation private
✓ Demonstrates responsiveness
✓ Other customers see you're proactive
```

**Real-Life Example: Zappos**
```
Situation: Customer tweeted complaint about delayed shoes for wedding

Zappos Response:
1. Replied within 30 minutes
2. Overnighted replacement shoes for free
3. Included handwritten apology note
4. Threw in free upgrade

Result:
- Customer became brand advocate
- Story shared 50,000+ times
- "Zappos customer service" became legendary
- Case study used in business schools
```
