### 6.6.2 Brand Searches

#### What Are Brand Searches?

Brand searches occur when users search specifically for your company name or branded terms rather than generic keywords.

**Examples:**
- "Nike shoes" (branded) vs. "running shoes" (generic)
- "Salesforce CRM" (branded) vs. "CRM software" (generic)
- "Buffer social media" (branded) vs. "social media scheduler" (generic)

#### Why Brand Searches Matter for SEO

**1. Google's Quality Score**
Google views brand searches as a vote of confidence. High brand search volume indicates:
- User trust and loyalty
- Positive user experiences
- Strong brand awareness

**2. Click-Through Rate (CTR) Boost**
Branded searches have much higher CTR:
- Generic keyword CTR: 2-5%
- Branded keyword CTR: 30-60%

**Real-Life Example:**
Amazon's brand power:
```
Generic Search: "buy books online"
- Amazon ranks but competes with other retailers
- CTR: ~5%

Brand Search: "Amazon books"
- Amazon owns the entire first page
- CTR: 55%+
- Lower CPC on paid ads
- Higher conversion rate: 15% vs. 2%
```

#### Strategies to Increase Brand Searches

**Strategy 1: Offline Marketing That Drives Online Searches**

**Real-Life Example: Dollar Shave Club**
```
Campaign: Viral YouTube Video (2012)
- Funny, memorable video about razor subscriptions
- Cost: $4,500 to produce
- Result:
  - 27 million views
  - "Dollar Shave Club" searches increased 10,000%
  - 12,000 orders in first 48 hours
  - Acquired by Unilever for $1 billion
```

**Strategy 2: Create a Unique Brand Name**

**Naming Best Practices:**
```
✅ Good Brand Names:
- Spotify (unique, memorable)
- Shopify (clear, searchable)
- Mailchimp (quirky, distinctive)

❌ Poor Brand Names:
- "Best Marketing Solutions" (generic)
- "Quality Consulting Group" (forgettable)
- "Elite Services Inc." (too common)
```

**Real-Life Example:**
Before: "Backrub" (Google's original name)
After: "Google" 
- Unique, searchable, ownable
- Now gets 8.5 billion searches daily
- "Google it" became a verb
