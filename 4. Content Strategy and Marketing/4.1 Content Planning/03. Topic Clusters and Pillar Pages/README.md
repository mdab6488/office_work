### Topic Clusters and Pillar Pages

**Definition:** A modern SEO and content organization strategy where you create a comprehensive "pillar" page on a broad topic, supported by multiple related "cluster" content pieces that link back to the pillar.

**The Structure:**

1. **Pillar Page (Core Content)**
   - Comprehensive guide on a broad topic (2,000-5,000+ words)
   - Covers topic at high level
   - Links to all cluster content

2. **Cluster Content (Supporting Content)**
   - Detailed articles on specific subtopics
   - Each links back to pillar page
   - 10-20 pieces per pillar

3. **Strategic Interlinking**
   - Cluster content links to pillar
   - Related cluster content links to each other

**Benefits:**
- Improved SEO through semantic relevance
- Better user experience (organized information)
- Establishes topical authority
- Easier content planning
- Better internal link structure

**Real-Life Example: HubSpot's Topic Cluster Strategy**

**Pillar Page:** "The Ultimate Guide to Email Marketing"
**URL:** hubspot.com/email-marketing

**Cluster Content (Examples):**
1. "How to Write Email Subject Lines That Get Opened"
2. "Email Marketing Metrics You Should Track"
3. "Best Times to Send Marketing Emails"
4. "How to Build an Email List from Scratch"
5. "Email Automation Workflows for E-commerce"
6. "A/B Testing Your Email Campaigns"
7. "GDPR Compliance for Email Marketing"
8. "Email Design Best Practices"
9. "Re-engagement Email Strategies"
10. "Transactional vs. Marketing Emails"

Each cluster article links back to the main pillar page and to related cluster content.

**Results:**
- HubSpot saw significant organic traffic increases (reported 40%+ growth)
- Improved rankings for competitive keywords
- Longer site engagement times
