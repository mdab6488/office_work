### Writing for User Intent

User intent (or search intent) is the reason behind a search query. Understanding and matching this intent is crucial for ranking and satisfying users.

#### Four Types of Search Intent:

**1. Informational Intent**

User wants to learn something.

**Real-Life Example - Healthline:**

Query: "what causes acne"

Healthline's article structure:
```
- Quick answer at the top (hormones, bacteria, inflammation)
- Detailed breakdown of each cause
- Visual diagrams
- Related conditions
- When to see a doctor
- Prevention tips
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Educational tone
- Comprehensive explanations
- No aggressive sales pitches
- Multiple subheadings for easy scanning
- Links to related informational content

**2. Navigational Intent**

User wants to find a specific website or page.

**Real-Life Example - Nike:**

Query: "nike store near me" or "nike customer service"

Nike's approach:
- Store locator appears immediately
- Clear navigation to customer service
- No blog content trying to "educate" about shoes
- Direct paths to what users seek

**Content Strategy:** Create dedicated landing pages for brand terms, don't force blog content.

**3. Transactional Intent**

User is ready to purchase or take action.

**Real-Life Example - Amazon Product Pages:**

Query: "buy iPhone 15 Pro Max"

Amazon's content includes:
```
- Large "Add to Cart" and "Buy Now" buttons
- Price and availability (above the fold)
- Product specifications
- Customer reviews and ratings
- Comparison with similar products
- Shipping and return information
- Very little "educational" content
```

**Wrong Approach:** Writing a 2,000-word history of smartphones when someone wants to buy.

**4. Commercial Investigation Intent**

User is researching before making a purchase decision.

**Real-Life Example - Wirecutter (New York Times):**

Query: "best laptop for graphic design"

Their article structure:
```
# Best Laptops for Graphic Design (2024)

## Our Top Pick: [Product Name]
- Why we chose it
- Key specs
- Pros and cons
- Price comparison

## Best Budget Option: [Product Name]

## Best Premium Option: [Product Name]

## How We Tested (methodology)

## What to Look For (buying guide)

## Other Products We Tested
```

**Key Elements:**
- Clear recommendations
- Comparison tables
- Testing methodology (builds trust)
- Buying guides
- Affiliate links to purchase

#### Matching Content to Intent: A Framework

**Step 1: Analyze SERP (Search Engine Results Page)**

**Example Query:** "content marketing strategy"

Look at what's currently ranking:
- Position 1-3: Comprehensive guides (3,000+ words)
- Position 4-6: Templates and examples
- Position 7-10: Video content and case studies

**Conclusion:** Users want comprehensive, actionable guides, not surface-level blog posts.

**Step 2: Analyze User Intent Signals**

| Query | Intent Type | Content Needed |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| "how to tie a tie" | Informational | Step-by-step tutorial with images/video |
| "best running shoes" | Commercial Investigation | Comparison article, reviews, buying guide |
| "nike air max 270" | Navigational/Transactional | Product page or category page |
| "running shoes near me" | Transactional | Store locator, local inventory |

**Step 3: Create Intent-Matched Content**

**Real-Life Example - Moz's Approach:**

For "what is SEO" (informational):
- 5,000-word beginner's guide
- No product pitches in main content
- Educational videos embedded
- Glossary of terms
- Links to deeper learning resources
- Soft CTA at the end for their tools

For "SEO tools" (commercial investigation):
- Product comparison page
- Feature matrices
- Pricing information
- Free trial offers
- Customer testimonials
