### Content Updating

Content updating is the process of refreshing existing content to keep it accurate, relevant, and competitive. This is often more effective than creating new content.

#### Why Update Content?

**Real-Life Example - Google's Own Guidance:**

In their Search Quality Rater Guidelines, Google emphasizes:
- **E-E-A-T** (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- Freshness matters, especially for time-sensitive queries
- Outdated information is considered low-quality

**The Freshness Algorithm:**

Google's "Query Deserves Freshness" algorithm prioritizes recently updated content for certain queries.

**Queries that trigger freshness:**
- Recent events: "Olympics results"
- Regularly recurring events: "best tech gifts"
- Frequent updates: "iPhone reviews"
- Trending topics: "AI tools"

---

#### What Content to Update First

**Priority Framework:**

**Tier 1: Update ASAP (High ROI)**
- Positions 6-20 (easy wins to move to page 1)
- Good backlinks but declining traffic
- Strong internal traffic but poor rankings
- Outdated statistics or information

**Tier 2: Update Soon (Medium ROI)**
- Positions 21-50 (need more work)
- Thin content that could be expanded
- Old content with seasonal relevance approaching
- Content with high bounce rates

**Tier 3: Update Eventually (Lower ROI)**
- Positions 50+ (need major overhaul)
- Very old content still getting some traffic
- Complete rewrites needed

**Real-Life Example - Neil Patel's Process:**

He prioritizes updates based on:
```
ROI Score = (Monthly Traffic Potential × Conversion Rate) / (Hours to Update)

Example calculation:
Post A: (10,000 potential visitors × 3% conversion) / 3 hours = 100 ROI score
Post B: (50,000 potential visitors × 1% conversion) / 10 hours = 50 ROI score

Update Post A first!
```
