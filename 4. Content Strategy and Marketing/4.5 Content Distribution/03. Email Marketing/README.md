## Email Marketing

### What It Is
Email marketing involves distributing content directly to subscribers' inboxes. It's one of the highest ROI channels (averaging $36-42 for every $1 spent).

### Types of Email Content Distribution

#### 1. **Newsletter Campaigns**

**Real-Life Example: Morning Brew**
- Daily business news in conversational tone
- Consistent 6 AM send time
- Witty writing style that's easy to scan
- Result: 4+ million subscribers, 40%+ open rate

**Structure**:
```
Subject: ☕ [Curiosity-driven headline]

Preheader: [Extra context that complements subject]

Body:
- Personal greeting
- 3-5 curated stories with commentary
- Sponsored content (clearly labeled)
- Call-to-action
- P.S. with personality
```

**Best Practices**:
- Send consistently (same day, same time)
- Segment by interests/behavior
- A/B test subject lines
- Optimal send times: Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM or 2 PM

#### 2. **Content Digest Emails**

**Real-Life Example: Content Marketing Institute**
- Weekly roundup of their best content
- Curated external resources

### Email List Segmentation Strategies

### Email Design Best Practices

**Mobile Optimization** (60%+ of emails opened on mobile):

- Large, tappable buttons (44×44 pixels minimum)
- Font size 14px+ for body text
- Compress images for fast loading

**Accessibility**:
- Alt text for images
- High contrast text/background
- Semantic HTML structure
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey information

### Key Metrics
