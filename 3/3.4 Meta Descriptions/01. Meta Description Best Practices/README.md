## Meta Description Best Practices

### 1. Write Unique Descriptions for Every Page

**❌ Bad Example (Duplicate Descriptions):**
```html
<!-- Every page uses the same description -->
<meta name="description" content="Welcome to our website. We offer great products and services.">
```

**✅ Good Example (Unique Descriptions):**

Homepage:
```html
<meta name="description" content="Blue Bean Café serves artisan coffee and fresh pastries in Brooklyn. Visit us for the best espresso, cold brew, and homemade treats since 2015.">
```

Menu Page:
```html
<meta name="description" content="Explore our coffee menu featuring single-origin espresso, specialty lattes, cold brew, and seasonal drinks. All coffee is ethically sourced and roasted in-house.">
```

Contact Page:
```html
<meta name="description" content="Visit Blue Bean Café at 123 Brooklyn Ave. Open daily 7am-8pm. Call (555) 123-4567 or email hello@bluebeancafe.com for catering inquiries.">
```

### 2. Include Target Keywords Naturally

Google **bolds keywords** in meta descriptions that match the user's search query, making your result stand out.

**Example Search: "vegan meal prep"**

**Standard Description:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Learn how to prepare healthy meals for the week ahead with our simple guide and recipes.">
```
Nothing gets bolded.

**Keyword-Optimized Description:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Master vegan meal prep with our guide. Get 25 easy vegan recipes, grocery lists, and time-saving tips to prep healthy meals for the entire week.">
```
"Vegan meal prep" and "vegan recipes" get bolded, making it more eye-catching.

### 3. Answer the User's Question or Problem

**❌ Vague Description:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Our company provides various services to help you succeed.">
```

**✅ Specific, Problem-Solving Description:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Struggling with low website traffic? Our SEO services increase organic visitors by 200% on average. Free audit included.">
```

### 4. Make It Compelling and Actionable

Think of your meta description as **ad copy** competing with 9 other results.

**Real-World Example - REI:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Shop hiking boots at REI. Free shipping on orders $50+. Expert advice, 100% satisfaction guarantee, and member rewards. Find your perfect fit today.">
```

**Why it works:**
- Includes product (hiking boots)
- States benefits (free shipping, guarantee)
- Creates urgency (today)
- Builds trust (expert advice, member rewards)

### 5. Don't Duplicate the Title Tag

The meta description should **complement** the title, not repeat it.

**❌ Bad Example:**
```html
<title>Best Running Shoes 2025 - Expert Reviews</title>
<meta name="description" content="Best Running Shoes 2025 - Expert Reviews and comparisons.">
```

**✅ Good Example:**
```html
<title>Best Running Shoes 2025 - Expert Reviews</title>
<meta name="description" content="We tested 47 pairs of running shoes. Compare features, prices, and performance across Nike, Adidas, Brooks, and more. Find your perfect pair.">
```
