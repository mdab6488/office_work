## Branding in Title Tags

### Should You Include Your Brand Name?

**Short Answer:** It depends on brand recognition.

---

### When to Include Brand Name

**✅ Include Brand If:**
- You have strong brand recognition (Nike, Apple, Amazon)
- You want to build brand association
- Homepage and key landing pages
- Your brand name includes keywords

**Examples:**

**1. Strong Brand (Nike):**
```html
<title>Running Shoes for Men - Nike.com</title>
```
The brand adds value and trust.

**2. Keyword-Rich Brand Name:**
```html
<title>Chicago Pizza Delivery - Order Online | Chicago Pizza Co.</title>
```
"Chicago Pizza Co." reinforces the location keyword.

### When to Skip Brand Name

**❌ Skip Brand If:**
- You're a new/unknown brand
- Title is already at character limit
- The brand name doesn't add value
- Internal pages where keywords matter more

**Example - New Blog:**
```html
<!-- Less effective -->
<title>How to Train a Puppy | John's Pet Blog</title>

<!-- More effective -->
<title>How to Train a Puppy in 7 Days (Positive Reinforcement Guide)</title>
```

No one knows "John's Pet Blog" yet, so those characters are better used for keywords and value propositions.
