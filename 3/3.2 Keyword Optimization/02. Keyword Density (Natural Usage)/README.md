## 3.2 Keyword Optimization


### Keyword Density (Natural Usage)

**What It Is:**
The percentage of times your target keyword appears compared to total word count. Modern SEO focuses on natural usage rather than hitting a specific percentage.

**The Old Way (2010s):**
SEOs aimed for 2-3% keyword density, leading to awkward, over-optimized content.

**The Modern Approach (2025):**
Use keywords naturally. Focus on topic coverage and user experience.

**Real-Life Example:**

**Keyword:** "best running shoes"  
**Article Length:** 2,000 words

❌ **Keyword Stuffing (5% density = 100 mentions):**
```
"The best running shoes are essential. When looking for the best running 
shoes, you need the best running shoes that fit properly. We tested the 
best running shoes to find the best running shoes for runners. These 
best running shoes are the best running shoes available. The best running 
shoes will make your runs better..."

[Google penalty likely - unnatural, poor user experience]
```

✅ **Natural Usage (0.8% density = 16 mentions):**
```
"Finding the right running shoes can transform your training. We spent 
500 miles testing top-rated models to identify the best options for 
different foot types and running styles.

In this guide, you'll discover:

- How to choose the right shoe for your gait
- Price-to-performance analysis
- When to replace your trainers

Our testing process involved 10 runners trying each model on various 
terrains over 8 weeks..."

[Keywords appear naturally where they make sense]
```

**Modern Keyword Usage Guidelines:**

| Article Length | Natural Keyword Mentions |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| 500 words | 2-4 times |
| 1,000 words | 4-8 times |
| 2,000 words | 8-15 times |
| 3,000+ words | 12-20 times |

**What to Do Instead of Keyword Stuffing:**
1. Use synonyms and variations
2. Focus on semantic richness
3. Cover the topic comprehensively
4. Let keywords appear naturally
5. Prioritize readability

**Real-World Impact:**
A website reduced keyword density from 4% to 1% while improving content quality. Results:
- Rankings improved for 67% of target keywords
- Average position increased from 8.3 to 4.7
- Bounce rate decreased 23%
- Time on page increased 41%
