## 3.1 Content Optimization


### Content Quality and Relevance

**What It Is:**
Content quality means providing accurate, valuable information that fully answers the user's search intent. Relevance ensures your content matches what users are actually looking for.

**Why It Matters:**
Google's algorithm has evolved to understand context and user satisfaction. High-quality, relevant content keeps users on your page longer, reducing bounce rates and improving rankings.

**Real-Life Example:**

❌ **Poor Quality/Irrelevant:**
```
Query: "How to fix a leaking faucet"

Bad Content:
"Faucets are important fixtures in homes. They control water flow. 
Many brands make faucets. If you have problems, call a plumber. 
Visit our store for faucet deals!"
```

✅ **High Quality/Relevant:**
```

Good Content:

Here's how to fix it in 6 steps:

1. Turn off water supply under the sink

5. Reassemble in reverse order
