## 3. On-Page SEO

On-Page SEO refers to all optimization techniques applied directly to your website's pages to improve rankings and user experience. Unlike off-page SEO (backlinks, social signals), you have complete control over on-page elements.

## 3.1 Content Optimization


### Content Length and Depth

**What It Is:**
The comprehensiveness of your content. Longer content often ranks better because it covers topics more thoroughly.

**Why It Matters:**
According to Backlinko's analysis of 11.8 million Google results, the average first-page result contains 1,447 words. However, length alone doesn't guarantee rankings—depth of coverage matters more.

**Real-Life Example:**

**Topic:** "Best Running Shoes for Beginners"

❌ **Shallow (300 words):**
```
If you're starting to run, you need good shoes. Nike and Adidas make 
great running shoes. They provide cushioning and support. Visit a 
running store to try on different pairs. Expect to spend $80-150.
