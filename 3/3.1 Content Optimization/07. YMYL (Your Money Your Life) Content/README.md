## 3.1 Content Optimization



### E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

**What It Is:**
Google's quality guidelines for evaluating content creators and websites. Updated from E-A-T to E-E-A-T in December 2022 to emphasize first-hand experience.

**Why It Matters:**
Google uses E-E-A-T signals to determine if your content deserves to rank, especially for important topics like health, finance, and safety.

**The Four Components:**

#### 1. Experience (NEW in 2022)
First-hand, real-world experience with the topic.

**Real-Life Example:**

❌ **No Experience Demonstrated:**
```
Title: "Best Baby Strollers"
Author: John Smith (no credentials mentioned)

"Baby strollers are useful for parents. They help transport babies. 
The Bugaboo Fox is a popular model. It has good reviews on Amazon. 
Parents should research before buying."
```

✅ **Clear Experience Demonstrated:**
```
Title: "Best Baby Strollers: Tested With My Twins Over 2 Years"
Author: Sarah Johnson | Mother of twins | Tested 12 strollers since 2023

"I've pushed over 1,000 miles with my twins across city streets, hiking 
trails, and shopping malls. Here's what I learned testing 12 different 
strollers:

[Photo: Me with twins in stroller at local park, dated]

The Bugaboo Donkey 5 Twin ($1,899) survived:
✓ 6 months of daily park walks on gravel paths
✓ 3 flat tires (easy to replace)
✓ Coffee spill on fabric (cleaned easily)
✓ Narrow doorway test at our 1950s home (barely fit)

What I wish I knew before buying:
- The storage basket is too small for Costco runs
- One-handed fold sounds great but needs practice
- Twins grow out of it by age 3 (not the 4 years advertised)"
```

#### 2. Expertise
Demonstrated knowledge and qualifications in the topic.

**Real-Life Example:**

❌ **No Expertise Shown:**
```
Title: "How to Treat Depression"

[Article includes:]

Your reputation and how others view you in your field.

**How to Build It:**
- Get featured in reputable publications

**Real-Life Example:**

A personal finance blogger built authoritativeness by:

**Trust Signals:**
