### 3.9.2 Bounce Rate

**What is Bounce Rate?**

Bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who leave your website after viewing only one page, without taking any action (clicking links, filling forms, etc.).

**Formula:**
```
Bounce Rate = (Single Page Sessions / Total Sessions) × 100
```

**Real-Life Example: Understanding Good vs. Bad Bounces**

**Scenario 1: High Bounce Rate (BAD) - 85%**

**E-commerce Product Page:**
```
User searches: "wireless headphones under $50"
→ Clicks result
→ Lands on page showing $200 headphones
→ No price filters visible
→ Slow loading images
→ Leaves immediately
```

**Problem Indicators:**
- Content doesn't match search intent
- Poor user experience
- Misleading title or meta description

**Scenario 2: High Bounce Rate (GOOD) - 75%**

**Contact Information Page:**
```
User searches: "Starbucks near me phone number"
→ Clicks result
→ Finds phone number and address immediately
→ Calls the number and leaves page
```

**Why It's Good:**
- User found exactly what they needed
- Quick answer to simple query
- Mission accomplished

**Industry Benchmarks:**

| Website Type | Average Bounce Rate |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Blogs | 70-90% |
| E-commerce | 20-45% |
| Service Sites | 10-30% |
| Landing Pages | 60-90% |
| Content Sites | 40-60% |
