### 3.9.4 Click-Through Rate (CTR)

**What is Click-Through Rate?**

CTR is the percentage of people who see your website in search results and actually click on it. It's calculated by dividing clicks by impressions.

**Formula:**
```
CTR = (Clicks / Impressions) × 100

Example:
1,000 impressions
50 clicks
CTR = (50 / 1,000) × 100 = 5%
```

**Average CTR by Position:**

| Position | Average CTR | Position | Average CTR |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| #1 | 28-35% | #6 | 3-5% |
| #2 | 15-18% | #7 | 2-3% |
| #3 | 10-12% | #8 | 1.5-2% |
| #4 | 7-9% | #9 | 1-1.5% |
| #5 | 5-7% | #10 | 0.5-1% |
