## 3.8 Internal Linking

Internal linking is one of the most powerful and underutilized SEO strategies. It helps search engines understand your site structure, distributes ranking power, and improves user navigation.

## Summary and Best Practices

### Image SEO Checklist

✅ Descriptive, keyword-rich file names (hyphens, lowercase)
✅ Unique, descriptive alt text for every image (except decorative)
✅ Compress all images (aim for <200KB for most images)
✅ Use modern formats (WebP) with fallbacks
✅ Implement lazy loading (except above-fold images)
✅ Create responsive images with srcset/picture elements
✅ Submit image sitemap to Google Search Console
✅ Specify width/height to prevent layout shift

### Internal Linking Checklist

✅ Every page accessible within 3 clicks from homepage
✅ Strategic link distribution (priority to important pages)
✅ Varied, descriptive anchor text (avoid generic phrases)
✅ No orphan pages (every page has 1+ internal links)
✅ Deep linking to valuable nested content
✅ Regular audits for broken links
✅ Contextual links within content (not just navigation)
✅ Logical site hierarchy with breadcrumbs
