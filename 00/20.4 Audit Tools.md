Settings to Configure:
1. Mode: Spider (for crawling) or List (for URL analysis)
2. Limit: Set crawl limits or unlimited
3. Speed: Max threads (adjust based on server capacity)
   - Small sites: 5-10 threads
   - Large sites: 1-3 threads (avoid overload)
```

**Configuration Example - E-commerce Site:**
```
Mode: Spider
Crawl: HTML only (uncheck images, CSS, JavaScript if not needed)
Limits: 
  - Max URI Length: 2048
  - Max Folder Depth: 10
Respect: 
  ✓ robots.txt
  ✓ Meta Robots
  ✓ Canonical
User-Agent: Screaming Frog SEO Spider/17.0
```

#### Step 2: Running Basic Crawl

```
1. Enter domain: https://example.com
2. Click "Start"
3. Monitor progress in bottom panel
4. Wait for completion (green status bar)
```

**Real-World Example - News Website Audit:**

*Client: Regional news site with 50,000+ articles*
*Issue: Declining organic traffic despite publishing 20 articles/day*

```
Crawl Configuration:
- URL: https://newswebsite.com
- Mode: Spider
- Render JavaScript: Yes
- Crawl: Internal links only

Results Found:
- Total URLs Crawled: 52,347
- 404 Errors: 1,823 (3.5%)
- Redirect Chains: 456
- Missing Meta Descriptions: 12,459 (23.8%)
- Duplicate Titles: 3,891 (7.4%)
- Thin Content (<200 words): 8,234 (15.7%)
```

#### Step 3: Analyzing Critical Issues

**Tab Navigation:**

1. **Internal Tab** - All crawled URLs
2. **Response Codes** - Filter by status
   - 4XX Client Errors
   - 5XX Server Errors
   - 3XX Redirects

3. **Page Titles** - Title optimization
   - Missing (0 length)
   - Duplicate
   - Over 60 characters
   - Under 30 characters

4. **Meta Description** - Meta tag analysis
   - Missing
   - Duplicate
   - Over 160 characters

5. **H1/H2** - Header structure
   - Missing H1
   - Multiple H1s
   - Duplicate H1s

**Example Analysis - 404 Errors:**

```
Filter: Response Codes > Client Error (4xx) > 404

Export Results:
Address | Inlinks | Status Code
https://example.com/old-product-page | 23 | 404
https://example.com/deleted-category | 45 | 404
https://example.com/moved-blog-post | 12 | 404

Action Plan:
1. High inlinks (>10): Create 301 redirects to relevant pages
2. Low inlinks (<5): Add to robots.txt disallow
3. External inlinks: Contact webmasters or create redirect

Implementation:
- 301 redirect old-product-page → /new-product-page
- 301 redirect deleted-category → /categories
- 301 redirect moved-blog-post → /blog/updated-post
```

#### Step 4: Advanced Features

**Custom Extraction - Extracting Prices:**

```
Configuration > Custom > Extraction

Name: Product Price
Extract: XPath
Expression: //span[@class='price']/text()

Real Example - E-commerce Audit:
- Crawled 5,000 product pages
- Extracted prices from HTML
- Found 234 products missing price schema markup
- Identified 89 products with $0.00 price (errors)
- Discovered 45 products with formatting issues
```

**JavaScript Rendering:**

```
Configuration > Spider > Rendering

Enable: JavaScript
Wait Time: 5 seconds (adjust based on site)
Ajax: Yes

Use Case - Single Page Application:
- Client: React-based e-commerce site
- Issue: Product pages not indexing
- Solution: 
  1. Crawl with JS rendering enabled
  2. Compare rendered vs. non-rendered HTML
  3. Found content loaded via AJAX not in initial HTML
  4. Recommendation: Implement SSR or prerendering
```

**Log File Analysis:**

```
Mode: Log File Analyser
File: Apache/Nginx access logs

Example Analysis:
- Upload: server-access-log-2024-10.log
- Date Range: October 1-31, 2024
- Filter: Googlebot

Insights:
- Googlebot crawled 45,000 URLs
- 23% were 404 errors (crawl waste)
- Top crawled: /old-pagination-pages (12,000 crawls)
- Recommendation: Block in robots.txt, reclaim crawl budget
```

### Real-World Case Studies

**Case Study 1: Enterprise Redirect Chain Fix**

*Background:*
- Client: Fortune 500 e-commerce site
- Site: 500,000+ product pages
- Issue: Page load delays, poor crawl efficiency

*Audit Process:*
```
1. Crawl with Screaming Frog
2. Reports > Redirect Chains

Findings:
- 12,847 redirect chains (2+ hops)
- Longest chain: 7 redirects
- Average chain length: 3.2 redirects

Example Chain:
https://site.com/product-old 
  → 301 → https://site.com/product-v2
  → 301 → https://site.com/product-v3
  → 301 → https://site.com/products/final

Impact:
- 600ms+ delay per chain
- Wasted 40% of Googlebot crawl budget
- Link equity dilution across redirects
```

*Solution:*
```
1. Export all redirect chains
2. Script to update chains to direct redirects
3. Update .htaccess:

Old:
Redirect 301 /product-old /product-v2
Redirect 301 /product-v2 /product-v3
Redirect 301 /product-v3 /products/final

New:
Redirect 301 /product-old /products/final
Redirect 301 /product-v2 /products/final
Redirect 301 /product-v3 /products/final
```

*Results (30 days):*
- Crawl efficiency: +67%
- Average page load: -400ms
- Organic traffic: +23%
- Pages indexed: +15,000

**Case Study 2: Duplicate Content Detection**

*Background:*
- Client: SaaS company blog
- Site: 5,000 blog posts
- Issue: Keyword cannibalization, declining rankings

*Audit Process:*
```
1. Crawl: https://blog.example.com
2. Tab: Page Titles > Duplicate

Findings:
- 1,234 duplicate title tags
- 892 pages with identical H1s
- Pattern: Similar posts targeting same keywords

Example:
Title: "Best CRM Software 2022" (12 variations)
- /best-crm-software
- /best-crm-software-2022
- /top-crm-software
- /crm-software-comparison
- /best-crm-tools
... (12 total)

All targeting: "best CRM software"
```

*Solution:*
```
Content Consolidation Strategy:

1. Export duplicate titles to Excel
2. Group by similarity (manual + clustering)
3. Identify canonical version (highest traffic/backlinks)
4. Merge content:
   - Keep best sections from each
   - Update with latest info
   - Add unique insights

5. 301 redirect duplicates to canonical:
   /best-crm-software-2022 → /best-crm-software
   /top-crm-software → /best-crm-software
   /crm-software-comparison → /best-crm-software
```

*Results (60 days):*
- Duplicate titles: -87% (1,234 → 160)
- Keyword cannibalization: -92%
- Average ranking position: +15 positions
- Organic traffic: +41%
- Conversions: +28%

### Best Practices

**1. Crawl Optimization:**
```
Small Sites (<1,000 pages):
- Speed: 10 threads
- Render JS: Always
- Images: Crawl if checking for broken images

Large Sites (>100,000 pages):
- Speed: 1-2 threads
- Respect robots.txt: Yes
- Use scheduling: Off-peak hours
- Sample crawl: Start with section
```

**2. Regular Audit Schedule:**
```
Website Size | Audit Frequency
<1,000 pages | Monthly
1,000-10,000 | Bi-weekly
10,000-100,000 | Weekly
>100,000 | Continuous monitoring (sample)
```

**3. Export Templates:**
```
Key Reports to Save:

1. Critical Issues Overview:
   - 404 errors with inlinks
   - Redirect chains >2 hops
   - Missing title/meta descriptions
   - Duplicate content
   - Broken internal links

2. Technical Health:
   - Response codes summary
   - Indexability status
   - XML sitemap coverage
   - Canonical implementation

3. Content Quality:
   - Thin content (<300 words)
   - Duplicate titles/descriptions
   - Header tag usage
   - Missing alt text
```

### Screaming Frog Limitations

**What It Doesn't Do Well:**
- Limited visualization (data-heavy tables)
- No automated scoring
- Requires manual interpretation
- Desktop-only (no cloud option)
- Single-site focus (no competitor comparison)

**When to Use Alternatives:**
- Need visual reports: → Sitebulb
- Want backlink data integrated: → Ahrefs
- Prefer cloud-based: → SEMrush
- Need automated prioritization: → Any alternative

### How to Use Ahrefs Site Audit

#### Step 1: Creating Your First Project

```
1. Dashboard > Site Audit > + New Project

Project Settings:
- Domain: example.com
- Crawl: Whole site
- Limit: Set based on plan
  - Lite: 5,000 URLs
  - Standard: 50,000 URLs
  - Advanced: 150,000 URLs
  - Agency: 300,000 URLs

Advanced Settings:
- Respect robots.txt: On
- Crawl scope: Subdomains (include/exclude)
- User-agent: Ahrefs Bot
- Max pages per domain: Unlimited
```

**Real-World Setup - Multi-Country E-commerce:**

```
Client: International electronics retailer
Domains: 
- example.com (US)
- example.co.uk (UK)
- example.de (Germany)
- example.fr (France)

Configuration:
Project 1: example.com
- Scope: Include all subdomains
- Limit: 50,000 pages
- Schedule: Weekly (Sunday 2 AM)
- Notifications: Critical issues only

Project 2-4: Regional sites
- Separate projects for each domain
- Limit: 25,000 pages each
- Schedule: Bi-weekly
```

#### Step 2: Understanding the Health Score

**Health Score Calculation:**
```
Formula: 100 - (weighted sum of issues)

Issue Severity Weights:
- Critical Errors: -3 points each
- Errors: -2 points each
- Warnings: -1 point each

Example Site:
Total Pages: 10,000
Critical: 50 issues = -150
Errors: 200 issues = -400
Warnings: 500 issues = -500
Total Deduction: -1,050

Health Score: 100 - (1,050/10,000 * 100) = 89.5/100
```

**Health Score Benchmarks:**
```
90-100: Excellent (minimal issues)
80-89: Good (minor optimizations needed)
70-79: Fair (moderate issues to address)
60-69: Poor (significant problems)
<60: Critical (major overhaul needed)

Industry Averages:
- SaaS sites: 82
- E-commerce: 76
- News/Media: 73
- Local business: 79
```

#### Step 3: Analyzing Issues

**Overview Dashboard:**

```
Ahrefs Site Audit Dashboard:

1. Health Score: 78/100 (Fair)

2. Issue Breakdown:
   Critical: 23
   - Broken internal links: 12
   - 5XX server errors: 8
   - Missing canonical: 3

   Errors: 156
   - 404 pages with backlinks: 45
   - Redirect chains: 67
   - Missing H1: 44

   Warnings: 892
   - Slow loading pages: 234
   - Large HTML size: 178
   - Low word count: 312
   - HTTP/HTTPS mixed: 168

3. Content Quality:
   - Average word count: 487
   - Thin content (<200 words): 312 pages
   - Duplicate content: 89 pages
```

**Internal PageRank Analysis:**

```
Reports > Internal PageRank

What It Shows:
- Distribution of link equity across site
- Pages with highest internal authority
- Orphan pages (no internal links)
- Pages with disproportionate link value

Real Example - Corporate Website:

Top Pages by Internal PR:
1. Homepage: 100
2. /contact: 67 (over-linked in footer)
3. /about: 45
4. /services: 23 (should be higher)
5. /privacy-policy: 19 (over-linked)

Issues Found:
- Service pages underlinked (low PR)
- Legal pages overlinked (high PR, low value)
- Important product pages: orphaned (PR: 0)

Action Plan:
1. Add service links to homepage
2. Create services hub page
3. Reduce footer link prominence
4. Add internal links to product pages from blog
```

#### Step 4: Critical Issues Prioritization

**Broken Internal Links:**

```
Issue: Broken Internal Links (Critical)
Impact: Crawl errors, poor UX, lost link equity

Example Report:
Source URL | Target URL (404) | Anchor Text | Links
/blog/seo-guide | /resources/tools | "SEO tools" | 45
/products | /old-product-page | "View details" | 234
/about/team | /team/john-doe | "John Doe" | 12

Priority Actions:
1. High link count (>50): Fix immediately
   - Update /products internal links
   - Change /old-product-page to correct URL

2. Medium (10-50): Fix within week
   - Update /blog/seo-guide
   - Create redirect for /resources/tools

3. Low (<10): Fix in next sprint
   - Update /about/team links
   - Remove or redirect /team/john-doe
```

**5XX Server Errors:**

```
Issue: 5XX Server Errors (Critical)
Impact: Pages not crawled, no indexing, lost traffic

Example Report:
URL | Status | Error Type | Last Checked
/api/products | 503 | Service Unavailable | 2024-11-10
/checkout | 500 | Internal Server Error | 2024-11-09
/search?q=test | 504 | Gateway Timeout | 2024-11-08

Investigation Steps:
1. Check server logs for patterns
2. Identify resource constraints
3. Test during different times
4. Monitor database queries

Real Case:
- /checkout throwing 500 errors
- Server log: Database timeout
- Root cause: Unoptimized checkout query
- Solution: Add database index, optimize query
- Result: 500 errors eliminated
```

**404 Pages with Backlinks:**

```
Issue: 404 Pages with External Backlinks (Error)
Impact: Lost link equity, poor user experience

Example Report:
404 URL | Backlinks | Referring Domains | Top DR
/blog/guide-2020 | 156 | 23 | 78 (Forbes.com)
/product/discontinued | 89 | 12 | 65 (TechCrunch)
/resources/whitepaper | 234 | 45 | 82 (HubSpot)

Priority Matrix:
High DR (>60) + Many backlinks: Immediate 301
Medium DR (40-60): Fix within week
Low DR (<40) + Few backlinks: Monitor

Action Plan:
1. /blog/guide-2020 → 301 to /blog/guide-2024
2. /product/discontinued → 301 to /products/alternatives
3. /resources/whitepaper → Restore page or redirect to similar

Impact Estimation:
- Recovered backlink value: DR 78 + DR 82 = significant
- Estimated traffic recovery: 500-800 visitors/month
- Improved site authority from link equity preservation
```

  3. Create direct 301: source → destination
  4. Remove intermediate redirects
  5. Update sitemap
  6. Update internal links

Example Fix:
OLD:
/womens/dresses/summer → 301 → /women/dresses/summer-dresses
/women/dresses/summer-dresses → 301 → /w/dresses/summer
/w/dresses/summer → 301 → /collections/summer-dresses

NEW:
/womens/dresses/summer → 301 → /collections/summer-dresses
/women/dresses/summer-dresses → 301 → /collections/summer-dresses
/w/dresses/summer → 301 → /collections/summer-dresses

```
Multi-Site Management:
- Group related sites in folders
- Consistent naming: "Client - Domain - Country"
- Example: "Acme Corp - acme.com - US"

Scheduling Strategy:
Small sites (<10K pages): Weekly
Medium sites (10K-100K): Bi-weekly
Large sites (>100K): Monthly full, weekly sample

Notification Setup:
Critical issues: Immediate email
New errors: Daily digest
Warnings: Weekly summary
Health score drop >5 points: Immediate
```

**2. Issue Prioritization Framework:**
```
Priority = (Severity × Reach × Backlink Value) / Effort

Severity:
- Critical: 10
- Error: 5
- Warning: 1

Reach:
- Affects all pages: 10
- Category level: 5
- Individual pages: 1

Backlink Value (if applicable):
- DR 70+: 10
- DR 50-69: 5
- DR <50: 2
- No backlinks: 0

Effort:
- Quick fix (<1 hour): 1
- Medium (1-8 hours): 5
- Complex (>8 hours): 10

Example Calculation:
Issue: 404 page with DR 75 backlink
Score: (10 × 1 × 10) / 1 = 100 (High Priority)

Issue: Missing meta description on 100 pages
Score: (1 × 5 × 0) / 5 = 1 (Low Priority)
```

**3. Integration with Other Ahrefs Tools:**
```
Workflow: Combined Technical + Backlink Audit

1. Run Site Audit
   - Identify 404s with backlinks
   
2. Check Site Explorer → Backlinks
   - See exact backlinks to 404s
   - Identify highest DR sources
   
3. Check Top Pages
   - Find most valuable pages
   - Ensure they're error-free
   - Optimize top performers

4. Check Organic Keywords
   - Which keywords lost rankings?
   - Cross-reference with technical issues
   - Prioritize fixes for revenue keywords

5. Content Gap Analysis
   - Find keyword opportunities
   - Ensure technical foundation solid
   - Plan new content strategy
```

### Ahrefs Limitations

**What It Lacks:**
- Desktop version (cloud-only)
- Custom extraction (like Screaming Frog)
- Visual reporting (not as good as Sitebulb)
- Detailed crawl control
- Free tier (requires paid subscription)

**When to Use Alternatives:**
- Need offline access: → Screaming Frog
- Want better visual reports: → Sitebulb
- Require custom data extraction: → Screaming Frog
- Budget constraints: → Screaming Frog (free tier)

#### Step 3: Fixing Issues by Theme

**Crawlability Issues:**

```
Report: Crawlability > Broken Internal Links

Issue Details:
Pages with Broken Links: 12
Total Broken Links Found: 67

Example:
Source Page: /blog/seo-guide-2024
Broken Link: /resources/keyword-tool (404)
Anchor Text: "free keyword tool"
Number of Occurrences: 23 pages linking

Batch Fix Process:
1. Identify common broken URLs
2. Determine correct destination
3. Options:
   a) Create 301 redirect
   b) Update links at source
   c) Restore deleted page

Action: Create redirect
/resources/keyword-tool → 301 → /tools/keyword-research

Implementation (WordPress):
# .htaccess
Redirect 301 /resources/keyword-tool /tools/keyword-research

Mark as Fixed in SEMrush:
- Click "Mark as Fixed"
- Re-crawl to verify
- Issue removed from report
```

**HTTPS Implementation:**

```
Report: HTTPS > Mixed Content

Issue: Pages Serving HTTP Resources
Pages Affected: 34
Impact: Browser warnings, security risks

Example Page: https://example.com/blog/article
Mixed Content:
- Image: http://example.com/images/photo.jpg
- Script: http://cdn.example.com/analytics.js
- Stylesheet: http://fonts.googleapis.com/css

Detection Method:
1. SEMrush identifies HTTP resources on HTTPS pages
2. Browser console shows warnings
3. Check "Not Secure" in address bar

Fix Strategy:
Automatic Fix (Preferred):
# .htaccess - Force all resources to HTTPS
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

# Or use header
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "upgrade-insecure-requests"
</IfModule>

Manual Fix:
1. Update image URLs: http:// → https:// or //
2. Update scripts to HTTPS versions
3. Check embedded content (videos, maps)
4. Validate with SSL checker

Real Example - E-commerce Site:
Before: 34 pages with mixed content
- Product images loaded via HTTP
- Third-party scripts not HTTPS
- Embedded YouTube videos used HTTP

After Implementation:
- Updated image CDN to force HTTPS
- Migrated to HTTPS versions of scripts
- Changed YouTube embeds to HTTPS
- Result: 0 mixed content warnings
- Bonus: +3% conversion rate (trust factor)
```

**Site Performance Optimization:**

```
Report: Site Performance > JavaScript and CSS

Issue: Render-Blocking Resources
Pages Affected: 201
Impact: Slow initial page load, poor Core Web Vitals

Example Page Analysis:
URL: /blog/complete-guide
Load Time: 4.2 seconds
Time to Interactive: 5.8 seconds

Render-Blocking Resources:
1. /css/style.css (89 KB)
2. /js/jquery.min.js (92 KB)
3. /css/bootstrap.css (145 KB)
4. /js/main.js (56 KB)
5. Google Fonts (34 KB)

Optimization Strategy:

1. Critical CSS Inline:
<head>
<style>
/* Inline critical above-the-fold CSS */
body { font-family: Arial; margin: 0; }
.header { background: #fff; padding: 20px; }
/* ... */
</style>

<!-- Load full CSS async -->
<link rel="preload" href="/css/style.css" as="style" onload="this.onload=null;this.rel='stylesheet'">
<noscript><link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css"></noscript>
</head>

2. Defer JavaScript:
<!-- Don't load JS until page loaded -->
<script defer src="/js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script defer src="/js/main.js"></script>

<!-- Or use async for independent scripts -->
<script async src="/js/analytics.js"></script>

3. Font Optimization:
<!-- Preconnect to font CDN -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>

<!-- Load fonts with display: swap -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

Results After Optimization:
- Load Time: 4.2s → 1.8s (57% faster)
- Time to Interactive: 5.8s → 2.3s (60% faster)
- Core Web Vitals:
  - LCP: 3.2s → 1.4s (Good)
  - FID: 120ms → 45ms (Good)
  - CLS: 0.18 → 0.05 (Good)
```

**Case Study 2: International E-commerce Hreflang Fix**

*Background:*
- Client: Electronics e-commerce
- Sites: 8 countries (US, UK, DE, FR, ES, IT, NL, SE)
- Initial Health Score: 71/100
- Problem: Duplicate content, hreflang errors

*Audit Discovery:*

```
SEMrush Site Audit - International SEO Report:

Hreflang Errors Found:
1. Missing Return Links (1,234 pages)
   - US site has hreflang to UK
   - UK site missing hreflang back to US
   
2. Incorrect Language Codes (456 pages)
   - Using "en" instead of "en-US"
   - Using "de" instead of "de-DE"
   
3. Missing X-Default (All sites)
   - No fallback for unmatched regions
   
4. Conflicting Signals (234 pages)
   - Canonical pointing to wrong region
   - Hreflang pointing to different URL

Example Product Page:
US Site: https://electronics.com/product/laptop
Hreflang Tags Found:
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-US" href="https://electronics.com/product/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-GB" href="https://electronics.co.uk/product/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="de-DE" href="https://electronics.de/produkt/laptop" />

Issues:
1. Missing return links (UK, DE sites don't reference US)
2. Missing other regions (FR, ES, IT, NL, SE)
3. No x-default tag
4. UK site has canonical to US version (incorrect)
```

*Solution Implementation:*

```
Hreflang Architecture Design:

Correct Implementation:
Each product page should have complete set:

US Site (electronics.com/product/laptop):
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-US" href="https://electronics.com/product/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en-GB" href="https://electronics.co.uk/product/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="de-DE" href="https://electronics.de/produkt/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="fr-FR" href="https://electronics.fr/produit/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="es-ES" href="https://electronics.es/producto/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="it-IT" href="https://electronics.it/prodotto/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="nl-NL" href="https://electronics.nl/product/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="sv-SE" href="https://electronics.se/produkt/laptop" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://electronics.com/product/laptop" />

UK Site (electronics.co.uk/product/laptop):
[Same complete set of hreflang tags]

German Site (electronics.de/produkt/laptop):
[Same complete set of hreflang tags]

[Repeat for all 8 regions]

Implementation Method:
1. Dynamic generation via CMS template
2. Database mapping of product URLs across regions
3. Automated validation script

PHP Example (WordPress):
<?php
$regions = array(
    'en-US' => 'https://electronics.com',
    'en-GB' => 'https://electronics.co.uk',
    'de-DE' => 'https://electronics.de',
    'fr-FR' => 'https://electronics.fr',
    'es-ES' => 'https://electronics.es',
    'it-IT' => 'https://electronics.it',
    'nl-NL' => 'https://electronics.nl',
    'sv-SE' => 'https://electronics.se'
);

foreach ($regions as $locale => $domain) {
    $url = $domain . get_current_page_path();
    echo '<link rel="alternate" hreflang="' . $locale . '" href="' . $url . '" />';
}

// X-default (fallback to US)
echo '<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://electronics.com' . get_current_page_path() . '" />';
?>

Canonical Tag Correction:
- Each region should self-reference canonical
- Remove cross-region canonical tags

Before (Incorrect):
UK Site: <link rel="canonical" href="https://electronics.com/product/laptop" />

After (Correct):
UK Site: <link rel="canonical" href="https://electronics.co.uk/product/laptop" />
```

*Validation Process:*

```
Step 1: SEMrush Re-Crawl
- Run site audit on all 8 domains
- Check International SEO report
- Verify hreflang errors reduced

Step 2: Google Search Console
- Check "International Targeting" report
- Verify no hreflang errors
- Monitor per-country impressions

Step 3: Manual Spot Checks
- Test 100 random product pages
- Validate hreflang tags present
- Check reciprocal links exist
- Confirm x-default present

Validation Script:
# Python script to validate hreflang
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def check_hreflang(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    hreflang_tags = soup.find_all('link', rel='alternate', hreflang=True)
    
    regions = ['en-US', 'en-GB', 'de-DE', 'fr-FR', 'es-ES', 
               'it-IT', 'nl-NL', 'sv-SE', 'x-default']
    
    found = [tag['hreflang'] for tag in hreflang_tags]
    missing = [r for r in regions if r not in found]
    
    if missing:
        print(f"Missing hreflang on {url}: {missing}")
    else:
        print(f"✓ All hreflang tags present on {url}")

# Test sample URLs
test_urls = [
    'https://electronics.com/product/laptop',
    'https://electronics.co.uk/product/laptop',
    'https://electronics.de/produkt/laptop',
]

for url in test_urls:
    check_hreflang(url)
```

   - Run full crawl
   - Export all issues
   - Prioritize (critical → warning)

2. Create Tickets
   - Jira/Asana/Trello integration
   - Assign to developers
   - Set deadlines
   - Add context from SEMrush

3. Mark as Fixed
   - Once resolved, mark in SEMrush
   - Re-crawl to verify
   - Update documentation

4. Continuous Monitoring
   - Weekly scheduled crawls
   - Alert on new critical issues
   - Track health score trend
   - Monthly performance reviews
```

### SEMrush Limitations

**What It Lacks:**
- Free tier (paid only)
- Desktop version (cloud-based only)
- Custom extraction capabilities
- Deep crawl control
- Unlimited crawl depth

**When to Use Alternatives:**
- Need desktop tool: → Screaming Frog
- Want better visualization: → Sitebulb

#### Step 3: Using the Hint System

**What Makes Sitebulb Unique: Automated Hints**

```
Example: Broken Internal Links

Sitebulb Detection:
Issue: Broken Internal Links
Severity: Critical
Pages Affected: 12
Total Links: 67

Hint #1: "Why This Matters"
Broken internal links create a poor user experience and waste 
crawl budget. Google can't discover or rank pages it can't access.
These broken links are preventing Googlebot from crawling 67 URLs.

Hint #2: "How to Find"
Navigate to: Audit > URLs > Response Codes > 404
Export the report showing:
- Source URL (where the broken link is)
- Target URL (the 404 page)
- Anchor text
- Number of links

Hint #3: "How to Fix"
Option 1 (Recommended): Create 301 redirects
For each broken link, redirect the 404 page to relevant content:
404 page → 301 → Relevant existing page

Option 2: Update links at source
If many pages link to the broken URL, update the links to 
point to the correct destination.

Option 3: Restore content
If the page was accidentally deleted and had value, restore it.

Hint #4: "How to Verify"
After implementing fixes:
1. Re-run Sitebulb audit
2. Check "Compare to Previous" report
3. Verify 404 count decreased
4. Monitor Search Console for crawl errors

Expected Outcome:
- Improved crawl efficiency
- Better user experience
- Recovered link equity
- Reduced bounce rate

Hint #5: "Prevention"
- Implement broken link monitoring
- Use 301 redirects when deleting pages
- Maintain URL structure when redesigning
- Regular audits (monthly minimum)
```

**Real-World Example - Title Tag Optimization:**

```
Issue: Missing Title Tags
Severity: Critical
Pages Affected: 8
URLs Missing Titles:
- /products/new-arrivals
- /blog/category/seo
- /about/team
- /contact/locations
- /resources/downloads
- /help/faq
- /pricing/plans
- /demo/request

Sitebulb Hint: "Title Tag Best Practices"

What Title Tags Do:
- Primary ranking factor for page topics
- Shown in search results (affects CTR)
- Displayed in browser tabs
- Social media sharing preview

Why Missing Titles Hurt:
- Google creates title from other page elements
- May not accurately represent page content
- Poor CTR in search results
- Missed ranking opportunity
- Unprofessional appearance

How to Write Good Titles:
1. Length: 50-60 characters (512 pixels)
2. Include primary keyword
3. Make it compelling (click-worthy)
4. Unique for every page
5. Brand placement (end or omit)

Page-Specific Recommendations:

/products/new-arrivals
Current: [Missing]
Suggested: "New Arrivals - Latest Products | BrandName"
Keywords: new arrivals, latest products, [product category]

/blog/category/seo
Current: [Missing]
Suggested: "SEO Tips & Strategies | BrandName Blog"
Keywords: SEO tips, SEO strategies, SEO blog

/about/team
Current: [Missing]
Suggested: "Our Team - Meet the Experts | BrandName"
Keywords: [company name] team, about us, company experts

Implementation Template:
HTML: <title>{{ page_title }} | {{ site_name }}</title>

WordPress:
function custom_title() {
    if (is_front_page()) {
        return 'BrandName - Tagline';
    } elseif (is_single()) {
        return get_the_title() . ' | BrandName Blog';
    } elseif (is_page()) {
        return get_the_title() . ' | BrandName';
    }
}

Testing:
1. Implement titles
2. Check in Sitebulb: View Source > Title Tag
3. Validate length with Moz Title Tag Checker
4. Preview in Google SERP Simulator
5. Monitor CTR in Search Console
```

"What: 45 pages missing main headlines
Why it matters: Google uses headlines to understand 
  what your pages are about. Without them, your pages 
  may not rank for relevant searches.
Business impact: Lost ranking opportunities for 45 pages
Fix: Add descriptive headlines to each page
Time required: 2-3 hours
Expected outcome: Better rankings for target keywords"

**Case Study 2: Internal Link Structure Optimization**

*Background:*
- Client: Large content publisher
- Site: 50,000+ blog posts
- Problem: Poor internal linking, orphan pages
- Goal: Optimize link structure for crawlability

*Sitebulb Analysis:*

```
Link Graph Visualization:

Initial State:
- Orphan pages: 1,234 (no internal links)
- Average links per page: 3.2 (too low)
- Link distribution: Highly uneven
  - Homepage: 4,567 inlinks
  - Important posts: 2-5 inlinks
  - Old posts: 0-1 inlinks

Sitebulb Insights:

1. Orphan Page Report
URL | Backlinks | Organic Traffic
/blog/high-value-post-1 | 23 | 450/mo
/blog/evergreen-content | 45 | 890/mo
/blog/conversion-focused | 12 | 320/mo
[1,234 total orphan pages]

Issue: High-value content not linked internally
Impact: Wasted link equity, poor crawl discovery

2. Internal PageRank Analysis
Top Pages by Internal PR:
1. Homepage: 100
2. About page: 45 (footer link)
3. Contact page: 42 (footer link)
...
100. High-value blog post: 2 (only 1 internal link)

Issue: Link equity flowing to low-value pages
Impact: Important content undervalued

3. Link Depth Analysis
Depth 1 (Homepage): 50 pages
Depth 2: 234 pages
Depth 3: 1,567 pages
Depth 4+: 48,149 pages (too deep!)

Issue: Most content too far from homepage
Impact: Harder for Googlebot to discover, lower value
```

*Implementation Strategy:*

```
Phase 1: Link Orphan Pages

Approach 1 - Contextual Internal Links:
- Analyze orphan page topics
- Find related published content
- Add 3-5 contextual links to each orphan

Example:
Orphan Page: "/blog/advanced-seo-techniques"
Topics: Technical SEO, link building, content optimization

Added Links From:
1. /blog/seo-guide (link: "advanced SEO techniques")
2. /blog/technical-seo (link: "more advanced strategies")
3. /blog/link-building (link: "combining with these techniques")
4. /blog/content-marketing (link: "advanced optimization methods")
5. /resources/seo (link: "advanced techniques guide")

Result: Orphan page now has 5 internal links

Approach 2 - Programmatic Links:
- Create "Related Posts" widget
- Algorithm: Similar topics + recency
- Display on all blog posts

Code Example (WordPress):
function related_posts($post_id) {
    $tags = get_the_tags($post_id);
    $tag_ids = array();
    
    foreach($tags as $tag) {
        $tag_ids[] = $tag->term_id;
    }
    
    $args = array(
        'tag__in' => $tag_ids,
        'post__not_in' => array($post_id),
        'posts_per_page' => 5,
        'orderby' => 'rand'
    );
    
    return get_posts($args);
}

Result: Every post gets 5 related internal links

Phase 2: Hub Page Strategy

Create Topic Hubs:
- Identify main content topics (20 topics)
- Create comprehensive hub pages
- Link hub to all related content
- Link all related content back to hub

Example Hub: "Complete SEO Guide"
Structure:
/seo-guide (hub page)
  ├── Links to 50 SEO-related posts
  ├── Organized by subtopic
  └── Regularly updated

Each Related Post:
- Link to hub: "Part of our Complete SEO Guide"
- Link to 2-3 related posts
- Link to other relevant hubs

Result: Strong topical clusters

Phase 3: Homepage Optimization

Previous: 23 links from homepage
- 15 navigation links
- 5 footer links
- 3 featured content links

New: 50+ links from homepage
- 20 navigation (dropdown menus)
- 10 footer (useful links only)
- 20 featured content (rotates weekly)
- 10 hub page links (strategic placement)

Result: More link equity distributed

Implementation:
<!-- Homepage Hub Section -->
<section class="topic-hubs">
  <h2>Explore Our Guides</h2>
  <div class="hub-grid">
    <a href="/seo-guide">SEO Guide</a>
    <a href="/content-marketing">Content Marketing</a>
    <a href="/social-media">Social Media</a>
    <!-- 20 total hubs -->
  </div>
</section>
```

### 2. Large Site Strategies

```
Crawling 1M+ Page Sites:

Challenge: Cannot crawl entire site efficiently

Solution: Segmented Auditing

1. Segment by Priority:
   High Priority (Crawl Weekly):
   - Homepage
   - Main category pages
   - Top 100 landing pages
   - Conversion pages
   
   Medium Priority (Crawl Monthly):
   - Secondary categories
   - Top 1,000 pages
   - Blog homepage
   - Resource sections
   
   Low Priority (Crawl Quarterly):
   - Archive pages
   - Old blog posts
   - Low-traffic sections
   - Support pages

2. Sample-Based Auditing:
   - Crawl 10% random sample
   - Analyze patterns
   - Extrapolate to full site
   - Deep dive on problem areas

3. Log File Analysis:
   Tool: Screaming Frog Log Analyzer
   - What is Googlebot actually crawling?
   - Where is crawl budget spent?
   - What's being ignored?
   
4. Progressive Depth Crawling:
   Week 1: Depth 0-2 (priority pages)
   Week 2: Depth 3-4 (important pages)
   Week 3: Depth 5+ (deep pages)
   Week 4: Full site comparison

Implementation Example:
# Screaming Frog Configuration for Large Sites
Mode: List
Input: Top_1000_URLs.txt

For Each Segment:
1. Crawl segment
2. Export issues
3. Analyze patterns
4. Scale to full site

Results:
- Manageable audit size
- Focused improvements
- Scalable insights
- Efficient resource use
```

### 3. Continuous Monitoring

```

Tools for Continuous Monitoring:
1. Google Search Console
   - Daily index coverage
   - Real-time crawl errors
   - Performance tracking

2. Uptime Monitors
   - Pingdom
   - UptimeRobot
   - StatusCake

3. Speed Monitoring
   - PageSpeed Insights API
   - WebPageTest API
   - Custom Lighthouse CI

4. Broken Link Checkers

    # Check for critical issues
    critical = [i for i in issues if i.severity == 'critical']
    
    if critical:
        send_alert(critical)
    
    # Log results
    log_to_database(issues)

schedule.every().day.at("03:00").do(daily_health_check)
```
