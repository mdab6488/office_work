## Content Quality Assessment

Content quality is the foundation of on-page SEO. Google's algorithms increasingly prioritize helpful, relevant, and high-quality content.

### 1. Content Relevance & Search Intent

#### What to Check:
- Does content match the search intent (informational, navigational, transactional, commercial)?
- Does it answer the user's primary question?
- Is it comprehensive enough for the topic?

#### Real-Life Example:

**Bad Example** (Keyword: "best running shoes for beginners")
```
Poor Content:
- 300 words listing shoe brands
- No sizing guides
- No budget recommendations
- Generic affiliate links
```

**Good Example** (Same keyword)
```
Quality Content:
- 2,500+ words comprehensive guide
- Sections: Types of running shoes, sizing guide, budget ranges
- Comparison tables with pros/cons
- Video demonstrations
- FAQ section
- Expert quotes from podiatrists
- Personal testing methodology
```

#### How to Audit:

**Step 1**: Google your target keyword and analyze top 10 results
```
Keyword: "wordpress security best practices"

Top 10 Analysis:
- Average word count: 2,800 words
- Common sections: Plugins, Hosting, SSL, Backups, User Roles
- Content types: Step-by-step guides (70%), Video tutorials (40%)
- Update frequency: Most updated within 6 months
```

**Step 2**: Use Content Gap Analysis
```python
# Content Gap Checklist
Target Page Topics: [List current topics]
Competitor 1 Topics: [List their topics]
Competitor 2 Topics: [List their topics]
Competitor 3 Topics: [List their topics]

Missing Topics = (Competitor Topics) - (Your Topics)
```

**Step 3**: Search Intent Verification
```
Query: "iphone 15 pro"

SERP Analysis:
- Position 1-3: Official product pages (Navigational)
- Position 4-6: Review articles (Informational)
- Position 7-10: Comparison articles (Commercial Investigation)

Your Content Should: Match the dominant intent in top 5
```

### 5. Content Uniqueness

#### Duplicate Content Check:

**Tools to Use:**
```
1. Copyscape (External duplicates)
2. Screaming Frog (Internal duplicates)
3. Siteliner (Site-wide duplicate check)
4. Google Search Console (Duplicate title/meta tags)
```

**How to Check:**

**Method 1: Manual Google Search**
```
1. Take unique sentence from your content
2. Put in quotes: "exact sentence from your article"
3. Search in Google
4. Check if it appears on other sites

Example:
Search: "The fundamental principle of keyword clustering involves grouping semantically related terms"
Result: Should only show your site
```

**Method 2: Copyscape Premium**
```
1. Enter URL: https://yoursite.com/article
2. Run batch search
3. Review results:

Results Example:
- 0 matches = Unique ✓
- 1-5 matches = Check if they're citing you
- 5+ matches = Likely plagiarism or syndication issue
```

**Internal Duplicate Issues:**
```
Common Problems:

1. Printer-friendly versions
   Fix: Add canonical tag or noindex

2. Pagination
   Fix: Use rel="next" and rel="prev"

3. Product variations
   Fix: Canonical to main product page

4. HTTP vs HTTPS
   Fix: 301 redirect all HTTP to HTTPS

5. WWW vs non-WWW
   Fix: Choose one, redirect the other

Example Canonical Tag:
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/article" />
```

## Header Tags Analysis

Header tags (H1-H6) structure your content for both users and search engines, improving readability and SEO.

### 1. H1 Tag Optimization

#### H1 Best Practices:

```html
Rules:
✓ One H1 per page (main title)
✓ Include primary keyword naturally
✓ 20-70 characters optimal
✓ Unique across all pages
✓ Describe page content accurately
✓ Front-load important keywords
✗ No keyword stuffing
✗ Not identical to title tag (can be similar)
✗ Not the logo or site name
```

#### H1 Examples by Page Type:

**Homepage:**
```html
<!-- Poor -->
<h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>

<!-- Good -->
<h1>Professional SEO Services for E-commerce Brands</h1>

<!-- Excellent -->
<h1>E-commerce SEO Agency - Increase Sales by 300%</h1>
```

**Product Page:**
```html
<!-- Poor -->
<h1>Product</h1>

<!-- Good -->
<h1>Men's Running Shoes - Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40</h1>

<!-- Excellent -->
<h1>Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40 - Men's Road Running Shoes</h1>
```

**Blog Post:**
```html
<!-- Poor -->
<h1>Blog Post About SEO</h1>

<!-- Good -->
<h1>How to Do Keyword Research for SEO</h1>

<!-- Excellent -->
<h1>Keyword Research Guide: Find Low-Competition Keywords That Rank</h1>
```

**Category Page:**
```html
<!-- Poor -->
<h1>Products</h1>

<!-- Good -->
<h1>WordPress SEO Plugins</h1>

<!-- Excellent -->
<h1>Best WordPress SEO Plugins - Compared & Reviewed 2025</h1>
```

### 2. H2-H6 Hierarchy

#### Proper Header Structure:

```html
<!-- Correct Hierarchy -->
<h1>Complete Guide to On-Page SEO</h1>

<h2>What is On-Page SEO?</h2>
  <h3>On-Page vs Off-Page SEO</h3>
  <h3>Why On-Page SEO Matters</h3>

<h2>Content Optimization</h2>
  <h3>Keyword Research</h3>
    <h4>Finding Long-Tail Keywords</h4>
    <h4>Keyword Difficulty Analysis</h4>
  <h3>Content Structure</h3>
    <h4>Using Bullet Points</h4>
    <h4>Paragraph Length</h4>

<h2>Meta Tags Optimization</h2>
  <h3>Title Tags</h3>
    <h4>Title Length Guidelines</h4>
    <h4>Keyword Placement</h4>
  <h3>Meta Descriptions</h3>

<!-- Incorrect Hierarchy (DON'T DO THIS) -->
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h3>Skipped H2 - BAD</h3>
<h2>Out of Order - BAD</h2>
<h4>Skipped H3 - BAD</h4>
<h1>Multiple H1s - BAD</h1>
```

#### Real Content Example:

```html
<article>
  <h1>How to Lose Weight Fast: Evidence-Based Guide</h1>
  
  <h2>Understanding Weight Loss Fundamentals</h2>
  <p>Content about calories, metabolism...</p>
  
    <h3>Caloric Deficit Explained</h3>

```

### 3. Keyword Distribution in Headers

#### Strategic Keyword Placement:

```html
Primary Keyword: "on-page seo"
Secondary Keywords: "content optimization", "meta tags", "internal linking"
LSI Keywords: "search rankings", "website optimization", "google seo"

<!-- Header Keyword Distribution -->
<h1>On-Page SEO Guide - Optimize Your Content for Google</h1>

<h2>What is On-Page SEO and Why It Matters</h2>
  <h3>On-Page SEO vs Technical SEO</h3>
  <h3>Impact on Search Rankings</h3>

<h2>Content Optimization Strategies</h2>
  <h3>Keyword Research for Website Optimization</h3>
  <h3>Writing SEO-Friendly Content</h3>

<h2>Meta Tags Best Practices</h2>
  <h3>Title Tag Optimization</h3>
  <h3>Meta Description Guidelines</h3>

<h2>Internal Linking Structure</h2>
  <h3>Building Topic Clusters</h3>
  <h3>Anchor Text Best Practices</h3>

Keyword Density in Headers:
- Primary keyword (on-page seo): 3 times (H1, H2, H3)
- Secondary keywords: 1-2 times each
- LSI keywords: Naturally distributed
- Total headers: 11
- Keyword stuffing: AVOIDED ✓
```

### 4. Header Tag Audit

#### Audit Process:

**Step 1: Crawl with Screaming Frog**
```
1. Run full site crawl
2. Go to: H1 > H1 tab
3. Check for:
   - Missing H1s
   - Multiple H1s
   - Duplicate H1s
   - H1 length issues

Export Report Columns:
- URL
- H1-1 (first H1)
- H1-2 (duplicate H1)
- H1 length
- H1 pixel width
```

**Step 2: Analyze Issues**
```csv
URL, H1, Issue, Priority, Action

/about, "", Missing H1, HIGH, Add descriptive H1
/blog/post-1, "Blog Post" | "Welcome", Multiple H1s, HIGH, Remove duplicate
/product/shoes, "Nike Shoes", Too Short, MEDIUM, Expand with model
/category/tech, Same as 10 pages, Duplicate, HIGH, Make unique
```

**Common H1 Issues:**

```markdown
1. Missing H1
   Impact: High
   Prevalence: 15-20% of pages
   Fix: Add descriptive H1 with primary keyword

2. Multiple H1s
   Impact: Medium
   Prevalence: 10-15% of pages
   Fix: Keep one H1, change others to H2

3. Duplicate H1s
   Impact: High
   Prevalence: 25-30% of pages
   Fix: Make each H1 unique and specific

4. H1 = Title Tag (Exact)
   Impact: Low
   Prevalence: 40-50% of pages
   Fix: Make H1 slightly different, more descriptive

5. Non-Descriptive H1s
   Examples: "Welcome", "Home", "Products"
   Impact: High
   Fix: Add keywords and context

6. H1 Too Long
   Over 70 characters
   Impact: Low
   Fix: Make more concise
```

### 5. Header Tag SEO Checklist

```markdown
For Each Page:

H1 Tag:
- [ ] One H1 per page
- [ ] Contains primary keyword
- [ ] 20-70 characters

## Internal Linking Review

Internal linking connects pages within your website, distributing page authority and helping users navigate.

### 1. Internal Link Structure

#### Link Architecture Types:

**Flat Structure (Best for Small Sites):**
```
Homepage
├── Page A
├── Page B
├── Page C
└── Page D

Characteristics:
- All pages 1-2 clicks from homepage
- Equal link equity distribution
- Simple navigation
- Best for: Sites with <50 pages
```

**Hierarchical Structure (Best for Medium Sites):**
```
Homepage
├── Category A
│   ├── Subcategory A1
│   │   ├── Product A1-1
│   │   └── Product A1-2
│   └── Subcategory A2
├── Category B
└── Category C

Characteristics:
- Clear parent-child relationships
- Organized by topics
- Scalable structure
- Best for: 50-1,000 pages
```

**Hub & Spoke (Pillar-Cluster Model):**
```
Pillar Page: "Complete SEO Guide"
├── Cluster 1: "Keyword Research"
├── Cluster 2: "On-Page SEO"
├── Cluster 3: "Link Building"
├── Cluster 4: "Technical SEO"
└── Cluster 5: "Local SEO"

Each cluster links back to pillar
Clusters link to related clusters

Best for: Content-heavy sites, blogs
```

#### Real Example - E-commerce Site:

```
Homepage (/)
├── Men's Clothing (/mens)
│   ├── Shirts (/mens/shirts)
│   │   ├── Casual Shirts (/mens/shirts/casual)
│   │   │   ├── Blue Oxford Shirt (/mens/shirts/casual/blue-oxford)
│   │   │   └── White Linen Shirt (/mens/shirts/casual/white-linen)
│   │   └── Dress Shirts (/mens/shirts/dress)
│   ├── Pants (/mens/pants)
│   └── Shoes (/mens/shoes)
└── Women's Clothing (/womens)

Internal Linking Strategy:
1. Homepage → Category pages
2. Category → Subcategory pages
3. Subcategory → Product pages
4. Product → Related products
5. Product → Category (breadcrumb)
6. Blog posts → Relevant products
```

### 2. Anchor Text Optimization

#### Anchor Text Types:

```html
1. Exact Match (Use Sparingly)
<a href="/on-page-seo">on-page SEO</a>

2. Partial Match (Best Practice)
<a href="/on-page-seo">learn about on-page optimization</a>

3. Branded
<a href="/service">SEO Corp's audit service</a>

4. Generic (Avoid Overuse)
<a href="/guide">click here</a>

5. Naked URL
<a href="https://example.com">https://example.com</a>

6. Image
<a href="/product"><img src="product.jpg" alt="Nike running shoes"></a>
```

#### Anchor Text Distribution:

```
Optimal Distribution for Internal Links:

Partial Match: 40-50%
- "comprehensive guide to on-page SEO"
- "learn more about keyword research"
- "our technical SEO audit service"

Branded: 20-30%
- "SEO Corp's methodology"
- "our proven approach"

Exact Match: 10-20%
- "on-page SEO"
- "keyword research"

Generic: 10-15%
- "read more"
- "learn more"
- "click here"

Naked URL: 5-10%
- https://example.com/guide

AVOID:
✗ Over-optimization (too many exact match)
✗ Keyword stuffing in anchors
✗ Repetitive anchor text to same URL
```

#### Real Examples:

**Poor Anchor Text:**
```html
<p>We offer SEO services. 
<a href="/seo-services">Click here</a> for SEO services. 
Our <a href="/seo-services">SEO services</a> are the best 
<a href="/seo-services">SEO services</a> available.</p>

Issues:
✗ Generic "click here"
✗ Exact match repeated 4 times
✗ Looks spammy
✗ No variety
```

**Good Anchor Text:**
```html
<p>Looking to improve your search rankings? Our 
<a href="/seo-services">comprehensive SEO solutions</a> 
have helped over 500 businesses achieve first-page rankings. 
<a href="/case-studies">See client results</a> or 
<a href="/contact">schedule a free consultation</a>.</p>

Benefits:
✓ Varied anchor text
✓ Descriptive and natural
✓ Contextually relevant
✓ Multiple relevant links
✓ User-focused
```

### 3. Internal Link Opportunities

#### Content Linking Strategy:

**Pillar Page Example:**

```markdown
# The Complete SEO Guide (Pillar Page)

Introduction paragraph...

## Chapter 1: Keyword Research
Brief overview (200 words)...
→ [Read the complete keyword research guide](/keyword-research)

## Chapter 2: On-Page SEO
Brief overview (200 words)...
→ [Master on-page optimization techniques](/on-page-seo)

## Chapter 3: Technical SEO
Brief overview (200 words)...
→ [Learn technical SEO fundamentals](/technical-seo)

## Chapter 4: Link Building
Brief overview (200 words)...
→ [Discover link building strategies](/link-building)

## Chapter 5: Local SEO
Brief overview (200 words)...
→ [Optimize for local search](/local-seo)

Internal Linking Rules:
1. Pillar page links to all cluster pages
2. Each cluster page links back to pillar
3. Related clusters link to each other
4. New related content links to pillar
```

**Contextual Linking in Blog Posts:**

```html
<!-- Article: "How to Do Keyword Research" -->

<p>Keyword research is the foundation of any successful SEO strategy. 
Before you can optimize your content, you need to understand what your 
audience is searching for. In this guide, we'll cover everything from 
<a href="/keyword-research-tools">choosing the right keyword research tools</a> 
to <a href="/keyword-difficulty">analyzing keyword difficulty</a>.</p>

<p>Once you've identified your target keywords, the next step is 
<a href="/on-page-seo">on-page optimization</a>. This includes 
incorporating keywords into your content, meta tags, and headers 
without over-optimization.</p>

<h2>Understanding Search Intent</h2>

<p>Search intent refers to the reason behind a user's search query. 
Understanding whether a user wants information, wants to make a purchase, 
or is looking for a specific website is crucial. We covered this in depth 
in our <a href="/search-intent-guide">complete guide to search intent</a>.</p>

Best Practices Shown:
✓ Links within content body (not footer/sidebar)
✓ Relevant and contextual
✓ Natural language
✓ Adds value to reader
✓ Links to related topics
✓ 2-5 internal links per 1,000 words
```

### 4. Link Equity Flow (PageRank Sculpting)

#### Strategic Link Placement:

```
Pages by Importance:

Tier 1 (Most Important):
- Homepage
- Main service/product pages
- High-converting landing pages
Links from: Every page
Number of internal links pointing to: 100+

Tier 2 (Important):
- Category pages
- Popular blog posts
- Core resource pages
Links from: Homepage, footer, navigation
Number of internal links: 50-100

Tier 3 (Supporting):
- Product pages
- Blog posts
- FAQ pages
Links from: Category pages, related content
Number of internal links: 10-50

Tier 4 (Least Important):
- Tag pages
- Author archives
- Old news/press releases
Links from: Minimal (consider noindex)
Number of internal links: <10
```

#### Example Site Architecture:

```
Homepage (Most Link Equity)
├─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│     │     │     │     │     │
▼     ▼     ▼     ▼     ▼     ▼
Cat1  Cat2  Cat3  Blog  About Contact
│     │     │     │
├───┬─┴─┬───┴───┬─┴────┬────┐
│   │   │       │      │    │
▼   ▼   ▼       ▼      ▼    ▼
Products        Posts

Link Equity Distribution:
1. Homepage has most authority
2. Categories get strong authority (direct links from homepage)
3. Products get authority from categories
4. Blog posts get authority from blog hub + related posts
5. Footer links to legal pages (minimal equity)
```

### 5. Internal Link Audit

#### Crawl Analysis with Screaming Frog:

**Step 1: Identify Orphan Pages**
```
Orphan Pages = Pages with ZERO internal links

Screaming Frog:
1. Crawl site
2. Reports > Crawl Diagnostics
3. Filter: "Orphan Pages" (pages in sitemap but no internal links)

Common Orphan Page Types:
- Old blog posts
- Archived products
- Forgotten landing pages
- Test pages
- Thank you pages

Fix:
- Add contextual links from relevant content
- Include in category/archive pages
- Add to sitemap
- 301 redirect if obsolete
- Noindex if necessary (thank you pages)
```

**Step 2: Find Pages with Low Internal Links**

```csv
URL, InLinks, OutLinks, Status, Action

/blog/old-post, 1, 5, Weak, Add 3-5 internal links
/product/seasonal, 2, 3, Weak, Link from category + related products
/pillar-guide, 50, 20, Strong, Maintain
/homepage, 200, 30, Strong, Good
```

**Step 3: Identify Over-Optimized Anchors**

```
Report: Link Metrics > Anchor Text

Warning Signs:
- Same exact match anchor 10+ times
- Keyword-stuffed anchors
- Too many footer/sidebar links

Example Issue:
Anchor Text: "buy Nike shoes" used 15 times
Fix: Vary to:
- "shop Nike footwear"
- "explore Nike shoe collection"
- "Nike running shoes"
- "see Nike styles"
```

**Step 4: Analyze Link Depth**

```
Crawl Depth Report:

Depth 0: Homepage (1 page)
Depth 1: 1 click from homepage (20 pages) ✓
Depth 2: 2 clicks from homepage (100 pages) ✓
Depth 3: 3 clicks from homepage (500 pages) ⚠
Depth 4: 4+ clicks from homepage (200 pages) ✗

Action Required:
- Pages at depth 4+: Add more internal links
- Reduce clicks to important pages
- Improve site navigation
- Add category pages if needed

Goal: All important pages within 3 clicks of homepage
```

### 6. Internal Linking Best Practices

```markdown
DO:
✓ Link to relevant, related content
✓ Use descriptive anchor text
✓ Link from within content body
✓ Prioritize new pages (link to them)
✓ Link to cornerstone content
✓ Update old posts with links to new content
✓ Use breadcrumbs for navigation
✓ Create hub pages that link to related content
✓ Add "Related Posts" sections
✓ Use 2-5 internal links per 1,000 words

DON'T:
✗ Use generic anchors excessively ("click here")
✗ Over-optimize with exact match keywords
✗ Link to irrelevant pages
✗ Create circular links (A→B→C→A with no escape)
✗ Hide links in footers/sidebars exclusively
✗ Link to low-quality or thin content
✗ Create too many links (dilutes value)
✗ Use same anchor text repeatedly to same URL
✗ Link to broken/404 pages
✗ Forget to update old content with new links
```

#### Internal Linking Checklist:

```markdown
New Content Publishing:
- [ ] Link from 3-5 existing related posts
- [ ] Link to 3-5 existing related posts
- [ ] Include link from relevant category page

#### Implementation Example:

```html
<!-- Modern Picture Element with Fallbacks -->
<picture>
  <!-- AVIF for newest browsers -->
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif">
  
  <!-- WebP for modern browsers -->
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  
  <!-- JPG fallback for older browsers -->
  <img src="image.jpg" 
       alt="Descriptive alt text" 
       width="1200" 
       height="630"
       loading="lazy">
</picture>

<!-- Responsive Images with Multiple Sizes -->
<picture>
  <!-- Desktop -->
  <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" 
          srcset="image-large.webp" 
          type="image/webp">
  <source media="(min-width: 1200px)" 
          srcset="image-large.jpg">
  
  <!-- Tablet -->
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" 
          srcset="image-medium.webp" 
          type="image/webp">
  <source media="(min-width: 768px)" 
          srcset="image-medium.jpg">
  
  <!-- Mobile -->
  <source srcset="image-small.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image-small.jpg" 
       alt="Descriptive alt text"
       loading="lazy">
</picture>
```

### 3. Alt Text Optimization

Alt text (alternative text) describes images for screen readers and appears when images fail to load.

#### Alt Text Best Practices:

```html
Good Alt Text Examples:

<!-- E-commerce Product -->
<img src="nike-pegasus-40.jpg" 
     alt="Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40 men's running shoe in blue and white colorway">

<!-- Blog Post Image -->
<img src="keyword-research-screenshot.jpg" 
     alt="Google Keyword Planner showing search volume for 'on-page SEO' keyword">

<!-- Infographic -->
<img src="seo-statistics-2025.png" 
     alt="Infographic showing 75% of users never scroll past first page of search results">

<!-- Chart/Graph -->
<img src="traffic-growth-chart.png" 
     alt="Line graph displaying 300% organic traffic increase from January to December 2025">

<!-- Logo -->
<img src="logo.svg" 
     alt="SEO Mastery logo">

<!-- Decorative Image (use empty alt) -->
<img src="decorative-divider.png" alt="">


Bad Alt Text Examples:

<!-- Too Generic -->
<img src="image1.jpg" alt="image"> ✗

<!-- Keyword Stuffing -->
<img src="shoes.jpg" 
     alt="running shoes best running shoes cheap running shoes buy running shoes online"> ✗

<!-- Redundant "image of" -->
<img src="dog.jpg" alt="image of a dog"> ✗
Correct: alt="Golden retriever puppy playing in grass"

<!-- File Name -->
<img src="IMG_1234.jpg" alt="IMG_1234.jpg"> ✗

<!-- Too Long -->
<img src="office.jpg" 
     alt="This is a photo of our modern office space with large windows overlooking the city, featuring ergonomic chairs, standing desks, collaborative workspaces, a kitchen area with coffee maker, plants, and our team of 20 employees working together"> ✗
(Keep under 125 characters)
```

#### Alt Text Formula by Image Type:

**Products:**
```
Formula: [Brand] [Product Name] [Key Feature] [Color/Size]

Examples:
"Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max 256GB in titanium blue"
"Samsung 65-inch 4K QLED Smart TV with HDR"
"Lululemon Align Leggings size 8 in black"
```

**Screenshots:**
```
Formula: [Tool/Platform] showing [What's Displayed]

Examples:
"Google Analytics dashboard showing 50,000 monthly visitors"
"WordPress admin panel displaying SEO plugin settings"
"Semrush keyword research report for 'content marketing'"
```

**People:**
```
Formula: [Name/Role] [Action] [Context]

Examples:
"CEO John Smith presenting at marketing conference"
"Customer service team assisting client in office"
"Dr. Sarah Johnson reviewing patient X-rays"
```

**Infographics:**
```
Formula: [Topic] infographic highlighting [Key Data Point]

Examples:
"Email marketing statistics infographic showing 4200% ROI"
"Social media usage infographic displaying 4.7 billion global users"
```

#### Alt Text SEO Strategy:

```html
<!-- Keyword Integration (Natural) -->
Target Keyword: "WordPress SEO"

Page: WordPress SEO Plugin Review

<img src="yoast-dashboard.jpg" 
     alt="Yoast SEO plugin dashboard in WordPress admin panel">

<img src="rank-math-settings.jpg" 
     alt="Rank Math SEO plugin configuration settings for WordPress">

<img src="all-in-one-seo.jpg" 
     alt="All in One SEO Pack features comparison for WordPress optimization">

Strategy:
✓ Keyword variation in each alt text
✓ Natural, descriptive language
✓ Adds context to content
✓ Not repetitive
✓ Helps rankings for image search
```

### 4. Image Dimensions & Responsive Images

#### HTML Width & Height Attributes:

```html
<!-- Always Include Dimensions -->
<img src="hero.jpg" 
     alt="Professional website design services"
     width="1920"
     height="1080"
     loading="lazy">

Benefits:
✓ Prevents layout shift (CLS)
✓ Browser reserves space before image loads
✓ Improves Core Web Vitals
✓ Better user experience

<!-- Responsive Images with srcset -->
<img src="image-800w.jpg"
     srcset="image-400w.jpg 400w,
             image-800w.jpg 800w,
             image-1200w.jpg 1200w,
             image-1600w.jpg 1600w"
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px,
            (max-width: 900px) 800px,
            (max-width: 1200px) 1200px,
            1600px"
     alt="Responsive hero image"
     width="1600"
     height="900"
     loading="lazy">

How it works:
- Browser chooses appropriate image based on screen size
- Saves bandwidth on mobile
- Maintains quality on desktop
- Reduces load time
```

### 5. Lazy Loading

Lazy loading defers loading of off-screen images until user scrolls near them.

#### Implementation:

**Native Lazy Loading (Modern Browsers):**
```html
<!-- Simplest Method -->
<img src="image.jpg" 
     alt="Description" 
     loading="lazy"
     width="800"
     height="600">

Browser Support: 95%+
Benefits:
✓ No JavaScript required
✓ Automatic browser optimization
✓ Improves page load speed
✓ Reduces initial bandwidth

When to Use:
✓ Below-the-fold images
✓ Long-scrolling pages
✓ Image galleries
✓ Blog posts with many images

When NOT to Use:
✗ Above-the-fold images
✗ LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) elements
✗ Critical hero images

Example:
<!-- Above the fold - eager load -->
<img src="hero.jpg" alt="Hero image" loading="eager">

<!-- Below the fold - lazy load -->
<img src="gallery-1.jpg" alt="Gallery image 1" loading="lazy">
<img src="gallery-2.jpg" alt="Gallery image 2" loading="lazy">
```

**JavaScript Lazy Loading (Legacy Support):**
```html
<!-- Using Intersection Observer API -->
<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  const lazyImages = document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]');
  
  const imageObserver = new IntersectionObserver(function(entries, observer) {
    entries.forEach(function(entry) {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        const img = entry.target;
        img.src = img.dataset.src;
        img.classList.remove('lazy');
        imageObserver.unobserve(img);
      }
    });
  });
  
  lazyImages.forEach(function(img) {
    imageObserver.observe(img);
  });
});
</script>

<img data-src="image.jpg" alt="Description" class="lazy">
```

### 6. Image SEO Audit

```

### 7. Image File Naming

#### File Naming Best Practices:

```
Good File Names:

✓ mens-blue-running-shoes-nike-pegasus.jpg
✓ wordpress-seo-plugin-settings-screenshot.png
✓ email-marketing-open-rate-statistics-2025.jpg
✓ customer-testimonial-john-smith-ceo.jpg

Bad File Names:

✗ image1.jpg (not descriptive)
✗ photo_final_v2_edit.png (internal naming)
✗ IMG_20251115_143022.jpg (camera default)
✗ best-running-shoes-for-men-cheap-affordable-buy-online.jpg (keyword stuffing)
✗ My Picture.jpg (spaces, capital letters)

Rules:
1. Use descriptive keywords
2. Lowercase only
3. Hyphens to separate words (not underscores or spaces)
4. Keep it concise (3-5 words)
5. Avoid special characters
6. Include context when helpful
7. Make it unique

Examples by Type:

Product:
brand-product-model-color.jpg
Example: samsung-galaxy-s24-titanium-gray.jpg

Blog Post:
topic-keyword-context.jpg
Example: seo-audit-checklist-2025.jpg

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Content Issues

**Issue 1: Thin Content**
```
Problem: Pages with <300 words, little value
Impact: Poor rankings, high bounce rate

Solution:
1. Audit pages with low word count (Screaming Frog)
2. Options:
   a) Expand content (add 1,000+ words)
   b) Consolidate multiple thin pages
   c) 301 redirect to better page
   d) Noindex if necessary (contact, legal)
3. Add value: images, videos, data, examples
4. Update regularly

Example:
Before: 200-word product description
After: 1,500-word comprehensive guide
- Detailed specs
- Usage instructions
- Comparison table
- Customer reviews
- FAQ section
- Video demonstration
```

**Issue 2: Duplicate Content**
```
Problem: Same content on multiple URLs
Impact: Diluted rankings, wasted crawl budget

Solution:
1. Identify duplicates (Siteliner, Copyscape)
2. Choose canonical version
3. Add canonical tag to duplicates:
   <link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/original">
4. Or 301 redirect duplicates
5. Update internal links

Common Causes:
- HTTP vs HTTPS
- WWW vs non-WWW
- URL parameters
- Printer-friendly versions
- Product variations
```

**Issue 3: Poor Readability**
```
Problem: Complex language, long paragraphs
Impact: High bounce rate, low engagement

Solution:
1. Target Flesch Reading Ease: 60-70
2. Shorten paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)
3. Use subheadings every 300 words
4. Add bullet points and lists
5. Use simple language
6. Include examples and analogies
7. Break up text with images

Before:
"The implementation of comprehensive search engine optimization methodologies necessitates the utilization of multifaceted approaches..."

After:
"Effective SEO requires multiple strategies working together..."
```

### Meta Tag Issues

**Issue 4: Missing Meta Descriptions**
```
Problem: Google creates its own snippet
Impact: Lower CTR, less control

Solution:
1. Crawl site (Screaming Frog)
2. Export pages with missing descriptions
3. Prioritize by traffic/importance
4. Write unique, compelling descriptions
5. Add to CMS
6. Verify in GSC

Bulk Fix Template:
- Export URL list
- Add column: "Meta Description"
- Fill in using formula:
  [What page offers] + [Benefit] + [CTA]
- Import back to CMS
```

**Issue 5: Duplicate Meta Descriptions**
```
Problem: Same description on multiple pages
Impact: Looks spammy, wasted opportunity

Solution:
1. Find duplicates (Screaming Frog)
2. Rewrite each to be unique
3. Include page-specific keywords
4. Differentiate by:
   - Specific product/service
   - Location (if local)
   - Unique benefit
   - Target audience

Example:
Page 1: "SEO services in New York - Rank higher on Google. Free consultation!"
Page 2: "Los Angeles SEO agency - Get more organic traffic. Call today!"
```

### Header Issues

**Issue 6: Multiple H1 Tags**
```
Problem: Multiple H1s on one page
Impact: Confuses search engines

Solution:
1. Identify pages (Screaming Frog > H1 tab)
2. Keep one primary H1
3. Change others to H2 or H3
4. Ensure H1 describes main topic

Example Fix:
Before:
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<h1>Our Services</h1>
<h1>Contact Us</h1>

After:
<h1>Professional SEO Services</h1>
<h2>Our Services</h2>
<h2>Contact Us</h2>
```

**Issue 7: Missing Header Hierarchy**
```
Problem: Skipping header levels (H1 to H3)
Impact: Poor structure, accessibility issues

Solution:
1. Audit header structure
2. Fix hierarchy:
   - H1 (once)
   - H2 (main sections)
   - H3 (subsections under H2)
   - H4 (subsections under H3)
3. Never skip levels

Correct Flow:
H1 → H2 → H3 → H4 → H2 → H3 → H2
```

### Internal Linking Issues

**Issue 8: Orphan Pages**
```
Problem: Pages with no internal links
Impact: Won't be crawled or indexed

Solution:
1. Find orphans (Screaming Frog + Sitemap)
2. Add contextual links from relevant pages

### Image Issues

**Issue 10: Large Image Files**
```
Problem: Images over 500 KB
Impact: Slow page load, poor Core Web Vitals

2. Compress all images:
   - Use TinyPNG, ShortPixel
   - Target: <100 KB for most images
3. Convert to WebP
4. Implement lazy loading
5. Use CDN for delivery

Bulk Fix:
- WordPress: Install ShortPixel plugin
- Manual: Use ImageOptim or Squoosh
- Automate future uploads
```

**Issue 11: Missing Alt Text**
```
Problem: Images without alt attributes
Impact: Poor accessibility, missed SEO opportunity

Solution:
1. Crawl site (Screaming Frog > Images)
2. Filter: Images without alt text
3. Add descriptive alt text
4. Include keywords naturally
5. Use empty alt="" for decorative images

Bulk Fix Script (WordPress):
```php
// Add to functions.php
function auto_alt_from_title( $attachment_id ) {
    if ( ! get_post_meta( $attachment_id, '_wp_attachment_image_alt', true ) ) {
        $image_title = get_the_title( $attachment_id );
        update_post_meta( $attachment_id, '_wp_attachment_image_alt', $image_title );
    }
}
add_action( 'add_attachment', 'auto_alt_from_title' );
```
