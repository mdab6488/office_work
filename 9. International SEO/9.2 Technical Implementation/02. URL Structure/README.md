#### URL Structure (ccTLDs, Subdirectories, Subdomains)

Choosing the right URL structure is one of the most important decisions in international SEO. This decision is hard to change later!

**Option 1: Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs)**

```
example.de  (Germany)
example.fr  (France)
example.co.uk  (United Kingdom)
example.jp  (Japan)
example.com.au  (Australia)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Strongest geo-targeting signal to search engines
- ✓ Builds local trust with users
- ✓ Can host locally for better performance
- ✓ Allows local hosting (required in some countries like China)
- ✓ Each domain can have independent SEO strategy

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Expensive (must buy each domain)
- ✗ Complex management (multiple domains)
- ✗ No shared domain authority (each starts from scratch)
- ✗ Requires more resources (hosting, maintenance)
- ✗ Some ccTLDs have restrictions (e.g., .au requires Australian presence)

**Real-Life Example: Amazon**

```
amazon.com     (United States)
amazon.co.uk   (United Kingdom)
amazon.de      (Germany)
amazon.fr      (France)
amazon.co.jp   (Japan)
amazon.com.mx  (Mexico)
amazon.in      (India)
```

**Why Amazon Uses ccTLDs:**
- Massive investment in each market
- Different inventory per country
- Local fulfillment centers
- Country-specific regulations
- Can benefit from local SEO boost

**When to Use ccTLDs:**
- Large enterprise with significant market investment
- Need to comply with local laws (data residency)
- Have resources to manage multiple domains
- Planning long-term country presence

**Option 2: Subdirectories (Folders)**

```
example.com/de/  (Germany)
example.com/fr/  (France)
example.com/uk/  (United Kingdom)
example.com/es/  (Spain)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Easiest to setup and maintain
- ✓ Shared domain authority (all links benefit main domain)
- ✓ Cost-effective (one hosting account)
- ✓ Easy to add new languages
- ✓ Unified analytics and tools

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Weaker geo-targeting signal than ccTLD
- ✗ Cannot server-host in different countries
- ✗ One domain penalty affects all languages
- ✗ Less local trust (some users prefer local domains)

**Real-Life Example: HubSpot**

```
hubspot.com/     (English - Default)
hubspot.com/de   (German)
hubspot.com/fr   (French)
hubspot.com/es   (Spanish)
hubspot.com/ja   (Japanese)
```

**Why HubSpot Uses Subdirectories:**
- Marketing tool - global appeal
- Want to consolidate domain authority
- Easier content management
- Unified brand presence
- Efficient resource use

**URL Pattern Variations:**

```
# Language-based (recommended)
example.com/en/  (English)
example.com/de/  (German)
example.com/fr/  (French)

# Region-based
example.com/us/  (United States)
example.com/uk/  (United Kingdom)
example.com/au/  (Australia)

# Combined (for multilingual regions)
example.com/ca/en/  (Canada English)
example.com/ca/fr/  (Canada French)
example.com/be/nl/  (Belgium Dutch)
example.com/be/fr/  (Belgium French)
```

**When to Use Subdirectories:**
- Small to medium businesses
- Limited resources
- Same product across markets
- Want to consolidate SEO efforts
- Mostly language targeting vs. regional

**Option 3: Subdomains**

```
de.example.com  (Germany)
fr.example.com  (France)
uk.example.com  (United Kingdom)
es.example.com  (Spain)
```

**Advantages:**
- ✓ Can host on different servers/locations
- ✓ Can separate by team/CMS if needed
- ✓ Flexibility in site structure
- ✓ Can have different site architecture per market

**Disadvantages:**
- ✗ Treated as separate sites by Google (less authority sharing)
- ✗ More complex setup than subdirectories
- ✗ Harder to track in analytics
- ✗ SSL certificates per subdomain
- ✗ Canonical and cross-linking complexity

**Real-Life Example: Craigslist**

```
newyork.craigslist.org
london.craigslist.org
paris.craigslist.org
tokyo.craigslist.org
```

**Why Craigslist Uses Subdomains:**
- Each city is entirely independent
- Different user bases
- Scalability (distributed servers)
- Legacy architecture

**When to Use Subdomains:**
- Technical requirement for separate hosting
- Completely different site structures per market
- Large enterprise with regional autonomy
- Existing subdomain infrastructure

**Hybrid Approach (Most Flexible)**

Many large companies use a combination:

**Example: Apple**

```
apple.com          (US - main site)
apple.com/uk/      (UK)
apple.com/de/      (Germany)
apple.com/fr/      (France)
apple.com/cn/      (China - subdirectory)
apple.com.cn       (China - also has ccTLD)
```

**Example: Booking.com**

```
booking.com           (Main domain)
booking.com/de/       (German language)
booking.com/fr/       (French language)

But also uses parameters:
booking.com/?lang=de  (For user preference)
```
