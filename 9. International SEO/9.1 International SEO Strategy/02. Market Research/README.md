**Example: Walmart in Germany (Failed)**

```markdown
Why Walmart Failed in Germany:

1. Cultural Misunderstandings:
   - US: "Smile at customers" → DE: "Considered flirting/insincere"
   - US: "Bag groceries for customers" → DE: "Don't touch my groceries"
   - US: "Company cheer every morning" → DE: "Weird corporate culture"

2. Business Practices:
   - Priced too low → Germans associated with poor quality
   - Didn't adapt to local shopping habits (smaller carts, daily shopping)

3. Language:
   - Corporate communications only in English
   - Management didn't speak German

Result: Lost $1 billion, exited Germany in 2006
