#### Global vs Local Strategy

**Global Strategy (Standardized Approach)**

A global strategy means using a consistent approach across all markets with minimal localization.

**When to Use:**
- Products/services are identical across markets
- Brand identity must remain consistent
- Limited resources for market-specific content
- Tech companies with universal products

**Real-Life Example: Apple**
```
Apple maintains consistent:
- Product naming (iPhone 15 Pro worldwide)
- Brand messaging and design
- Core product descriptions
- Only adapts: language, currency, local regulations
```

**URL Structure Example:**
```
apple.com/us/         (United States - English)
apple.com/mx/         (Mexico - Spanish)
apple.com/uk/         (United Kingdom - English)
apple.com/fr/         (France - French)

Note: Same product, minimal adaptation
```

**Advantages:**
- Easier to manage and maintain
- Consistent brand message
- Lower operational costs
- Centralized content creation

**Disadvantages:**
- May miss local market nuances
- Less culturally relevant
- Potentially lower conversion rates

**Local Strategy (Localized Approach)**

A local strategy means creating market-specific content, campaigns, and experiences.

**When to Use:**
- Products differ by market
- Cultural differences are significant
- High-value markets justify investment
- E-commerce with regional preferences

**Real-Life Example: McDonald's**
```
McDonald's adapts extensively:
- Menu items (McAloo Tikki in India, Teriyaki Burger in Japan)
- Marketing campaigns
- Pricing strategies
- Local partnerships
- Cultural celebrations
```

**URL Structure Example:**
```
mcdonalds.com.au      (Australia - localized menu)
mcdonalds.co.jp       (Japan - unique offerings)
mcdonalds.com.sa      (Saudi Arabia - Halal certified)
```

**Content Adaptation:**
```markdown
# US Site
"Our Big Mac is an American Classic"
Featured: Big Mac, Quarter Pounder

# India Site  
"Discover Our Vegetarian Delights"
Featured: McAloo Tikki, Maharaja Mac (chicken option)

# Japan Site
"Experience Our Teriyaki Taste"
Featured: Teriyaki Burger, Ebi Filet-O
```

**Advantages:**
- Higher cultural relevance
- Better local engagement
- Increased conversion rates
- Competitive advantage in local markets

**Disadvantages:**
- Higher costs
- Complex management
- Requires local expertise
- Slower rollouts

**Hybrid Strategy (Most Common)**

Most successful international brands use a hybrid approach.

**Real-Life Example: Airbnb**
```
Global Elements:
- Brand identity and logo
- Core platform functionality
- Trust & safety features

Local Elements:
- Payment methods (WeChat Pay in China, UPI in India)
- Customer support in local language
- Local laws compliance (registration numbers)
- Region-specific travel guides
- Local partnerships
```
