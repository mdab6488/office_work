### Content Adaptation

Content adaptation goes beyond language to adjust messaging, format, and presentation for different markets.

#### Types of Content Adaptation

**1. Visual Content Adaptation**

**Real Example: IKEA Catalogs**

**Saudi Arabia Version:**
- Removed all images of women (cultural requirement)
- Added more family-oriented room setups
- Larger dining tables (family gathering culture)
- Different bedroom layouts (separate sleeping areas)

**Sweden Version:**
- Gender-equal imagery
- Smaller furniture (smaller living spaces)
- Minimalist designs
- Sustainability messaging prominent

**2. Tone and Voice Adaptation**

**Example: Netflix Descriptions**

**United States (Casual, Direct):**
```
"Breaking Bad"
"A high school chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin fights to provide for his family."
```

**United Kingdom (Witty, Cultural References):**
```
"Breaking Bad"
"A chemistry teacher's mid-life crisis takes a rather illegal turn. Think Mr. Chips meets Scarface."
```

**Germany (Serious, Detailed):**
```
"Breaking Bad"
"Ein Chemielehrer aus New Mexico erhält eine Krebsdiagnose und beginnt, Methamphetamin 
herzustellen, um die finanzielle Zukunft seiner Familie zu sichern."
(More serious tone, detailed explanation, no humor)
```

**3. Topic and Subject Matter Adaptation**

**Example: Blogging Strategy**

**Fashion E-commerce Blog:**

**USA Content:**
- "10 Must-Have Sneakers for Summer 2024"
- Casual style, celebrity endorsements
- Size charts in US sizes

**France Content:**
- "L'Art de la Mode Parisienne: Comment Créer un Look Élégant"
- Sophisticated style, emphasis on elegance
- European sizes, fashion philosophy content

**Middle East Content:**
- "Modest Fashion: Elegant Abayas for Every Occasion"
- Modest clothing focus
- Different imagery, cultural sensitivity
- Content about local fashion weeks (Dubai, Riyadh)

**4. Search Intent Adaptation**

People in different countries search differently and have different intents.

**Example: Travel Website**

**Search Term: "Hotels in Paris"**

**US Searcher Intent:**
- Looking for deals
- Near tourist attractions
- English-speaking staff
- Booking convenience

**Content Focus:**
```
- "Best Budget Hotels Near Eiffel Tower"
- "Top 10 Hotels with English-Speaking Staff"
- Price comparison emphasized
```

**French Searcher Intent:**
- Looking for character/charm
- Authentic Parisian experience
- Quality over price
- Local recommendations

**Content Focus:**
```
- "Hôtels de Charme dans le Marais"
- "Chambres d'Hôtes Authentiques"
- History and character emphasized
```

**5. Seasonal Content Adaptation**

**Example: E-commerce Retail Calendar**

**Northern Hemisphere (USA/Europe):**
- Summer sales: June-August
- Back to school: August-September
- Holiday shopping: November-December
- Winter clearance: January

**Southern Hemisphere (Australia/Brazil):**
- Summer sales: December-February
- Back to school: January-February
- Holiday shopping: May-June (winter)

**Content Calendar Must Be Completely Flipped!**
