### What is Google Autocomplete?

Google Autocomplete (also called Google Suggest) is the predictive search feature that displays suggested queries as you type in the search box. These suggestions are based on real searches performed by users.

### How Autocomplete Works

**Ranking Factors**:
1. **Search Volume**: Popularity of the query
2. **Freshness**: Trending topics get priority
3. **Location**: Personalized based on geographic location
4. **Language**: User's language preferences
5. **Previous Searches**: Personal search history
6. **Trending Topics**: Current events and viral content

### Autocomplete Patterns

**Alphabet Soup Technique**:
Type your keyword + each letter of the alphabet to discover variations.

**Example for "coffee"**:
- coffee **a**ddiction
- coffee **b**eans
- coffee **c**reamer
- coffee **d**rinks
- coffee **e**nema
- coffee **f**ilter
- coffee **g**rinder
- (continue through z)
