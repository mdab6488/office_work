### Competitor Keyword Analysis

**What It Is:**
Analyzing which keywords your competitors are ranking for to discover opportunities and gaps in your own strategy.

**How to Do It:**

1. **Identify Your Top Competitors**
   - Direct competitors (same products/services)
   - Content competitors (ranking for your target keywords)
   - Indirect competitors (solving same problems differently)

2. **Analyze Their Keywords**
   - Use tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, or Moz
   - Look at their top-performing pages
   - Identify keyword gaps (keywords they rank for, but you don't)

3. **Evaluate Keyword Difficulty**
   - Can you realistically compete?
   - What would it take to outrank them?

**Real-Life Example:**

**Scenario:** You run an online yoga studio
