### Brainstorming Keywords

**What It Is:**
Brainstorming is the foundational step where you generate initial keyword ideas based on your business, products, services, and target audience needs.

**How to Do It:**

1. **Start with Your Core Offering**
   - List your main products/services
   - Think about what problems you solve
   - Consider your unique selling propositions

2. **Think Like Your Customer**
   - What would they type into Google?
   - What pain points are they trying to solve?
   - What language do they use (technical vs. casual)?

3. **Use Seed Keywords**
   - These are your basic, broad terms that serve as starting points

**Real-Life Example:**

Let's say you run a vegan bakery in Portland:

**Brainstorming Session:**
```
Core Business: Vegan Bakery

Seed Keywords:
- vegan bakery
- vegan cakes
- dairy-free desserts
- egg-free pastries
- plant-based baking

Problem-Solving Keywords:
- "where to buy vegan birthday cake"
- "dairy-free wedding cake"
- "vegan pastries near me"

Feature-Based Keywords:
- gluten-free vegan cookies
- organic vegan cupcakes
- custom vegan cakes
```

**Practical Exercise:**
Create a mind map starting with your main service in the center, then branch out to:
- Product types
- Customer pain points
- Occasions/use cases
- Ingredients/features
- Related services
