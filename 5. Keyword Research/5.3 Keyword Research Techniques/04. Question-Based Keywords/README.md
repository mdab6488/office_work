### Question-Based Keywords

**What It Is:**
Keywords phrased as questions that people actually ask search engines. These align with voice search and featured snippets.

**Why They're Powerful:**
- Match natural language queries
- Perfect for featured snippets (position zero)
- Great for voice search (Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant)
- Show clear user intent
- Excellent for content marketing

**Question Types:**

```
Who: "who invented pizza"
What: "what is SEO"
When: "when to plant tomatoes"
Where: "where to buy organic vegetables near me"
Why: "why is my website slow"
How: "how to bake sourdough bread"
Which: "which CRM is best for small business"
Can: "can dogs eat chocolate"
Should: "should I invest in cryptocurrency"
```

**Real-Life Example:**

**Scenario:** You're a financial advisor

**Traditional Keywords vs. Question Keywords:**

```
Traditional:
- "retirement planning" (High competition, vague intent)
- "401k" (Informational, low conversion)

Question-Based (Much Better):
- "how much should I have saved for retirement at 40?" 
  (Volume: 1,500/month, Clear intent, High engagement)
  
- "when should I start taking social security benefits?"
  (Volume: 2,000/month, Specific concern, High value)
  
- "can I retire at 55 with $500,000?"
  (Volume: 800/month, Specific situation, High conversion potential)
  
- "what happens to my 401k if I change jobs?"
  (Volume: 1,200/month, Common pain point, High engagement)
```
