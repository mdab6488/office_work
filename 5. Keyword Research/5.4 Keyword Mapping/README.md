**Scenario:** Launching a new yoga studio website in Denver, Colorado

### Step 1: Brainstorming Keywords
```
Core offering: Yoga classes in Denver
Seed keywords: yoga, yoga classes, yoga studio, Denver yoga
```

### Step 2: Competitor Analysis
```
Top competitors:
1. YogaPodDenver.com
2. Kindness-Yoga.com
3. DenverYogaUnderground.com

Keywords they rank for:
- "yoga classes Denver" - High competition
- "hot yoga Denver" - Medium competition
- "yoga studio downtown Denver" - Medium competition
- "beginner yoga Denver" - Low competition ✓ Opportunity
- "prenatal yoga Capitol Hill" - Very low competition ✓ Opportunity
```

### Step 3: Long-Tail Keyword Research
```
Found opportunities:
- "affordable yoga classes Denver" (400/mo) - Low competition
- "yoga for beginners Capitol Hill" (150/mo) - Very low competition
- "morning yoga classes downtown Denver" (200/mo) - Low competition
- "gentle yoga for seniors Denver" (120/mo) - Very low competition
```

### Step 4: Question-Based Keywords
```
Common questions:
- "how much are yoga classes in Denver?" (300/mo)
- "what should I wear to my first yoga class?" (250/mo)
- "do I need to be flexible to do yoga?" (180/mo)
- "what type of yoga is best for beginners?" (400/mo)
```

### Step 5: Seasonal Keywords
```
January: "New Year yoga classes Denver" (Peak: Jan)
June-August: "outdoor yoga Denver" (Peak: Summer)
September: "yoga teacher training Denver" (Peak: Fall)
```

### Step 6: Local Keywords
```
Primary local:
- "yoga Denver"
- "yoga classes Denver CO"
- "yoga studio Capitol Hill"
- "yoga near me" (Denver geo-target)

Neighborhood-specific:
- "yoga LoDo Denver"
- "yoga classes Cherry Creek"
- "Capitol Hill yoga studio"
```

### Step 7: Keyword Mapping
```
Homepage:
Primary: "yoga studio Denver"
Secondary: "yoga classes Denver CO", "Denver yoga"

Class Schedule Page:
Primary: "yoga class schedule Denver"
Secondary: "yoga times Denver", "when are yoga classes"

Beginner Classes Page:
Primary: "beginner yoga classes Denver"
Secondary: "yoga for beginners Denver", "intro to yoga"

Blog Post - Cluster 1:
Primary: "what to expect at your first yoga class"
Cluster: "first yoga class tips", "what to wear to yoga", 
         "yoga for beginners guide", "how to prepare for yoga"

Pricing Page:
Primary: "yoga class prices Denver"
Secondary: "affordable yoga Denver", "yoga membership cost"
```

### Step 8: Avoid Cannibalization
```
DON'T DO THIS:
❌ /beginner-yoga
❌ /yoga-for-beginners
❌ /intro-to-yoga
(Three pages competing for same keyword)

DO THIS:
✓ /beginner-yoga (comprehensive page)
301 redirect others OR repurpose them:
- /yoga-for-beginners → 301 to /beginner-yoga
- /intro-to-yoga → Repurpose as blog: "Your First Yoga Class: Complete Guide"
```

### Step 9: Keyword Clustering
```
Cluster 1: Beginner Yoga
Primary: "yoga for beginners"
Cluster keywords:
- beginner yoga classes
- intro to yoga
- yoga basics
- starting yoga
- first yoga class
→ Target with ONE comprehensive page

Cluster 2: Yoga Benefits
Primary: "benefits of yoga"
Cluster keywords:
- why do yoga
- yoga health benefits
- what does yoga do
- yoga advantages
→ Target with ONE blog post
```

### Final Keyword Strategy Document:
```
| Page | Primary Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Secondary Keywords | Notes |
|------|----------------|--------|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Homepage | yoga studio Denver | 2,400 | Medium | yoga Denver, yoga classes Denver | Priority 1 |
