### Assigning Keywords to Pages

**What It Is:**
Keyword mapping is the strategic process of assigning specific keywords to specific pages on your website, ensuring each page has a clear purpose and target.

**Why It's Critical:**
- Prevents keyword cannibalization
- Improves content relevance
- Enhances user experience
- Increases ranking potential
- Creates organized site structure

**The Keyword Mapping Process:**

**Step 1: Inventory Your Pages**
```
List all existing pages:
- Homepage
- Service/Product pages
- Category pages
- Blog posts
- Location pages
- About/Contact pages
```

**Step 2: Categorize Your Keywords**
```
By Search Intent:
- Informational: "how to", "what is", "guide"
- Navigational: Brand names, specific pages
- Transactional: "buy", "price", "order"
- Commercial Investigation: "best", "review", "vs"

By Funnel Stage:
- Top of Funnel (Awareness): Broad, educational
- Middle of Funnel (Consideration): Comparative, specific
- Bottom of Funnel (Decision): Transactional, ready to buy
```

**Step 3: Match Keywords to Pages**
```
One Primary Keyword per page
+ 2-5 Secondary (related) keywords per page
```

```

**Intent-Based Mapping:**

```
INFORMATIONAL INTENT (Blog/Resource Pages):
Keywords: how to, what is, guide, tips, tutorial
Example: 
- Page: /blog/how-to-train-a-puppy
- Keywords: "puppy training guide", "how to train a puppy", 
  "puppy training tips"

COMMERCIAL INTENT (Comparison/Review Pages):
Keywords: best, top, vs, review, comparison
Example:

  "dog food reviews"

TRANSACTIONAL INTENT (Product/Service Pages):
Keywords: buy, price, order, for sale, near me
Example:

  "order blue buffalo online"
```

**Real-Life Mapping Case Study:**

**SaaS Company - Project Management Software**

**Before Mapping:**
```
Problem: Multiple pages targeting same keywords
- Homepage targeting "project management software"
- Feature page targeting "project management software"
- Pricing page also trying to rank for "project management software"
Result: All pages ranked poorly (positions 40-50)
```

**After Strategic Mapping:**
```
Homepage:
Primary: "project management software"
Secondary: "best project management tool", "project management platform"
Result: Rank #6 → Rank #2

Features Page:
Primary: "project management features"
Secondary: "project management tools and features", "PM software features"
Result: Rank #18 → Rank #4

Pricing Page:
Primary: "project management software pricing"
Secondary: "PM software cost", "project management pricing plans"
Result: Not ranking → Rank #8

Comparison Page:
Primary: "[Brand] vs Asana"
Secondary: "[Brand] vs Monday.com", "project management software comparison"
Result: New page → Rank #5

Blog Post:
Primary: "how to choose project management software"
Secondary: "selecting PM software", "project management software guide"
Result: New page → Rank #3
```

**Outcome:**
- Organic traffic: +340%
- Conversions: +180%
