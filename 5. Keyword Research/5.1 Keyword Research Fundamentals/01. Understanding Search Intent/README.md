### Understanding Search Intent

Search intent (also called user intent) is the primary goal a user has when typing a query into a search engine. Understanding intent is the foundation of effective keyword research because Google prioritizes results that match user intent.

#### The Four Types of Search Intent

#### 1. **Informational Intent**
Users want to learn something or find information.

**Characteristics:**
- Question-based queries
- "How to," "What is," "Guide," "Tutorial"
- Users are in learning mode
- Typically top-of-funnel traffic

**Real-Life Examples:**
```
❌ Poor targeting: "buy running shoes" for a blog post about running tips
✅ Good targeting: "how to start running for beginners"
✅ Good targeting: "what are the benefits of morning runs"
✅ Good targeting: "running training plan for 5k"
```

**Real Business Example:**
**Scenario:** A fitness blog wants to attract readers.

**Bad Approach:** Writing an article about "best protein powder" but targeting buyers ready to purchase.

**Good Approach:** Creating content like:
- "How does protein powder help muscle recovery" (informational)
- "Complete guide to understanding protein supplements" (informational)
- Target keyword: "protein powder benefits" (1,200 monthly searches)

**Content Type:** Blog posts, guides, tutorials, glossaries, FAQs

#### 2. **Navigational Intent**
Users want to find a specific website or page.

**Characteristics:**
- Brand names in query
- Users already know where they want to go
- High brand loyalty
- Direct traffic substitute

**Real-Life Examples:**
```
✅ "Facebook login"
✅ "YouTube"
✅ "Amazon Prime Video"
✅ "Nike official site"
✅ "Gmail inbox"
```

**Real Business Example:**
**Scenario:** You run a SaaS company called "ProjectMaster."

**Why it matters:**
- If people search "ProjectMaster login" but your login page isn't optimized, they might land on competitor pages
- Need to own your brand keywords
- Protect against competitors bidding on your brand name

**Strategy:**
- Optimize your homepage for "[Brand Name]"
- Create dedicated pages for "[Brand Name] login," "[Brand Name] support"
- Monitor competitors bidding on your brand terms in Google Ads

**Content Type:** Homepage, login pages, product pages, location pages

#### 3. **Transactional Intent**
Users want to complete an action or make a purchase.

**Characteristics:**
- Strong buying signals
- "Buy," "Purchase," "Order," "Download," "Subscribe"
- Bottom-of-funnel traffic
- Highest conversion potential

**Real-Life Examples:**
```
✅ "buy iPhone 15 Pro Max 256GB"
✅ "order pizza near me"
✅ "subscribe to Netflix premium"
✅ "download Photoshop trial"
✅ "book hotel in Paris"
✅ "hire freelance web developer"
```

**Real Business Example:**
**Scenario:** An e-commerce store selling organic skincare products.

**Keyword Strategy:**
- Primary: "buy organic face cream" (500 searches/month, high intent)
- Secondary: "order natural moisturizer online" (300 searches/month)
- Long-tail: "buy vegan anti-aging serum free shipping" (50 searches/month)

**Why these work:**
- Clear purchase intent
- Users have credit card ready
- Higher conversion rates (3-5% vs 0.5-1% for informational)

**Landing Page Strategy:**
- Product pages with clear CTA
- Shopping cart functionality
- Trust signals (reviews, guarantees, secure payment)
- Urgency elements (limited stock, discounts)

**Content Type:** Product pages, service pages, pricing pages, checkout pages

#### 4. **Commercial Investigation Intent**
Users are researching before making a purchase decision.

**Characteristics:**
- Comparison queries
- "Best," "Top," "Review," "vs," "Alternative"
- Middle-of-funnel traffic
- Research phase before buying

**Real-Life Examples:**
```
✅ "best laptops for video editing 2025"
✅ "iPhone 15 vs Samsung Galaxy S24"
✅ "top email marketing software for small business"
✅ "Shopify vs WooCommerce comparison"
✅ "Ahrefs review honest opinion"
✅ "affordable CRM alternatives to Salesforce"
```

**Real Business Example:**
**Scenario:** You sell project management software.

**Keyword Strategy:**
Target comparison and review keywords where competitors are mentioned:

**Smart Targeting:**
- "Asana vs Monday.com vs [YourProduct]" (800 searches/month)
- "best project management tools 2025" (5,400 searches/month)
- "Trello alternatives for large teams" (600 searches/month)

**Content Strategy:**
Create comprehensive comparison page:
```markdown
Title: "Top 10 Project Management Tools for 2025: Complete Comparison"

Include:
- Feature comparison table
- Pricing breakdown
- Pros and cons for each tool
- Your tool positioned strategically
- Real user reviews
- CTA: "Try [YourProduct] Free for 14 Days"
```

**Why this works:**
- Intercepts users researching competitors
- Establishes authority
- Captures leads before they decide
- Conversion rate: 2-4% (between informational and transactional)

**Content Type:** Comparison pages, review articles, "best of" lists, buying guides, case studies
