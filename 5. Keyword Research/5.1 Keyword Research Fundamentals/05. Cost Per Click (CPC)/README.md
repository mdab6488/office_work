## Cost Per Click (CPC)

CPC indicates how much advertisers pay per click in Google Ads. It reveals commercial value and competition.

### Understanding CPC Values

```
$0.00 - $0.50 = Very low commercial value (informational content)
$0.51 - $2.00 = Low commercial value (some buying intent)
$2.01 - $5.00 = Moderate commercial value (good monetization potential)
$5.01 - $15.00 = High commercial value (strong buying intent)
$15.01 - $50.00 = Very high commercial value (premium services)
$50+ = Extremely high value (insurance, legal, finance industries)
```

### Real-Life Example: Legal Blog

**Scenario:** You're deciding between two keywords for your blog.

**Keyword A:**
```
Keyword: "what is a lawyer"
Search Volume: 8,100/month
CPC: $1.20
Keyword Difficulty: 45/100

Analysis:
- High volume looks attractive
- Low CPC = low commercial intent
- Searchers are students doing homework, not potential clients
- Monetization: Maybe display ads = $10-30/month revenue
```

**Keyword B:**
```
Keyword: "personal injury lawyer near me"
Search Volume: 1,900/month
CPC: $87.50
Keyword Difficulty: 78/100

Analysis:
- Lower volume
- High CPC = extremely high commercial intent
- Searchers are accident victims ready to hire
- Monetization: One client = $5,000-50,000 contingency fee
- Even ranking #5 = massive ROI
```

**Decision:** Target Keyword B. Lower volume but 1 client = 10,000x more revenue than informational traffic.

### Real Business Case: Insurance Industry

**Most Expensive CPCs (Real Data 2024-2025):**

```
1. "car insurance" = $55-65 per click
2. "best life insurance" = $50-60 per click
3. "personal injury attorney" = $80-120 per click
4. "mesothelioma lawyer" = $250-400 per click
```

**Why so high?**
- Customer lifetime value: $2,000-50,000
- One conversion pays for 1,000 clicks
- Intense competition drives prices up

**Your Strategy:**
If you're in a high-CPC industry:
- SEO is 10-50x more cost-effective than ads
- Ranking organically = free traffic worth $50+ per click
- Prioritize SEO investment over paid ads for long-term ROI

### CPC for Keyword Research (Even If You Don't Run Ads)

**Why CPC Matters for SEO:**

1. **Revenue Prediction:** High CPC = high commercial value = better monetization
2. **Competitive Analysis:** If CPC is $30+, companies are making money from this traffic
3. **Content Prioritization:** Focus on keywords where clicks have real value

**Example Decision Matrix:**

```
Keyword A: "healthy recipes"
- Volume: 110,000/month
- CPC: $0.80
- Your blog traffic: 50,000 visits/month
- Revenue potential: Display ads = $500/month

Keyword B: "meal prep delivery service near me"
- Volume: 2,900/month
- CPC: $12.30
- Your blog traffic: 1,000 visits/month
- Revenue potential: Affiliate commissions = $3,000/month

Winner: Keyword B (6x more revenue with 50x less traffic)
```
