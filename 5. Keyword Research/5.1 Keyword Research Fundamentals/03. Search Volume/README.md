## Search Volume

Search volume indicates how many times a keyword is searched per month. It helps prioritize which keywords to target.

### Understanding the Numbers

**Volume Ranges:**
```
🔴 0-10 searches/month = Ultra low volume (micro-niche)
🟡 10-100 searches/month = Low volume (long-tail opportunity)
🟢 100-1,000 searches/month = Medium volume (sweet spot for new sites)
🔵 1,000-10,000 searches/month = High volume (competitive)
🟣 10,000+ searches/month = Very high volume (extremely competitive)
```

### Real-Life Example: Fitness Blog Strategy

**Scenario:** You're launching a new fitness blog. You need to choose keywords.

#### ❌ Mistake: Targeting Only High Volume
```
Keyword: "weight loss" 
Search Volume: 450,000/month
Keyword Difficulty: 95/100
Your chances: 0.001%

Problem: You'll never rank because Nike, WebMD, and Mayo Clinic own this keyword.
```

#### ✅ Smart Approach: Volume Ladder Strategy

**Start with Low Volume, Low Competition:**
```
Keyword: "weight loss tips for busy moms over 40"
Search Volume: 90/month
Keyword Difficulty: 15/100
Your chances: 70-80%

Why this works:
- Specific audience
- Low competition
- Achievable ranking in 2-3 months
- Visitors are highly engaged (specific problem)
```

**Build Authority, Then Scale:**
```
Month 1-3: Target 10 keywords with 50-200 searches/month
Month 4-6: Target 10 keywords with 200-1,000 searches/month
Month 7-12: Target 5 keywords with 1,000-5,000 searches/month
Year 2+: Finally compete for "weight loss" (450,000/month)
```

### Real Business Case Study

**Company:** Backlinko (Brian Dean's SEO blog)

**Strategy:**
- Started with long-tail keywords: "link building strategies for new websites" (320 searches/month)
- Built authority over 2 years
- Now ranks #1 for "SEO" (90,500 searches/month) and "link building" (14,800 searches/month)

**Lesson:** Volume means nothing if you can't rank. Start small, build authority, scale up.
