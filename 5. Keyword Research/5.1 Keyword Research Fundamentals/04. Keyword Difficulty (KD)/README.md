## Keyword Difficulty (KD)

Keyword Difficulty is a metric (0-100) that estimates how hard it is to rank in the top 10 for a keyword.

### Understanding the Score

```
0-10 = Very Easy (new sites can rank in weeks)
11-30 = Easy (achievable with quality content)
31-50 = Moderate (needs strong content + some backlinks)
51-70 = Hard (established site with authority needed)
71-90 = Very Hard (requires significant SEO investment)
91-100 = Extremely Hard (dominated by industry giants)
```
