**Using Ubersuggest (Affordable Choice):**

   - Volume: 74,000/month
   - SEO Difficulty: 58 (Hard)
   - Paid Difficulty: 100 (Very Hard)
   - CPC: $1.28

   2. "handmade candles for gifts" (480 searches, SD: 18) ✅ Target
   3. "best scented candles for bedroom" (1,300 searches, SD: 35) ✅ Target
   4. "luxury candles brands" (2,900 searches, SD: 52) ❌ Skip (too hard)
   ```

   $12/month Ubersuggest Individual Plan = $144/year
   Savings: $1,044 to invest in content creation
   
   Result:
   - Found 50 viable keywords
   - Created 15 blog posts ($500 content budget)
   - 6 months: 2,000 monthly organic visitors
   - 40 monthly sales from organic traffic
   - ROI: $144 tool + $500 content = $644 total cost
   - Revenue from organic: $3,200 (40 sales × $80 average order)
   ```

**Lesson:** You don't need expensive tools if you have limited budget. Ubersuggest provides enough data for small businesses to succeed.
