## 3.2 Keyword Optimization


### LSI Keywords and Semantic SEO

**What It Is:**
LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) keywords are terms and phrases related to your main keyword. Semantic SEO means Google understands topics conceptually, not just by exact keyword matches.

**Why It Matters:**
Google's algorithm (especially after BERT and RankBrain updates) understands context. Including related terms proves you're covering a topic comprehensively.

**Real-Life Example:**

**Primary Keyword:** "best coffee maker"

**Related LSI Keywords Google Expects:**
- Brewing methods (drip, espresso, French press)
- Features (programmable, thermal carafe, grinder)
- Brands (Keurig, Ninja, Breville, Cuisinart)
- Capacity (single-serve, 12-cup, commercial)
- Price ranges
- Materials (stainless steel, glass carafe)
- Maintenance (descaling, filter replacement)
- Coffee terms (bloom, extraction, temperature)

❌ **Without LSI Keywords (Thin Content):**
```
"The best coffee maker makes great coffee. We reviewed coffee makers 
to find the best coffee maker. The XYZ coffee maker is the best coffee 
maker. Buy this coffee maker for the best coffee."

[200 words total, just repeating "coffee maker"]
```

✅ **With LSI Keywords (Comprehensive):**
```
"The best coffee maker depends on your brewing preferences and lifestyle.
