## Click-Through Rate Optimization

### Your Title Tag is Your Ad Copy

Even if you rank #1, a bad title won't get clicks. A compelling title from position #3 can get more clicks than a boring #1 title.

### 1. Use Numbers and Data

**❌ Without Numbers:**
```html
<title>Ways to Save Money on Groceries | Budget Tips</title>
```
CTR: ~2.3%

**✅ With Numbers:**
```html
<title>17 Ways to Save Money on Groceries (Cut Bills by 40%)</title>
```
CTR: ~4.7%

**Real-Life Examples:**
- BuzzFeed: "21 Pictures That Will Restore Your Faith In Humanity"

### 2. Use Power Words

Power words trigger emotional responses and increase clicks.

**Common Power Words:**
- **Urgency:** Now, Today, Limited, Hurry
- **Value:** Free, Best, Top, Ultimate
- **Curiosity:** Secret, Hidden, Revealed, Shocking
- **Trust:** Proven, Verified, Guaranteed, Tested

**❌ Boring Title:**

```

**✅ Compelling Title:**
```html

```

### 3. Add Current Year for Freshness

**Example:**
```html
<title>Best Laptops for College Students 2025 - Expert Reviews</title>
```

**Why it works:** Users prefer up-to-date information. Adding the year:
- Signals freshness
- Increases CTR by 10-20%
- Helps rank for "best [thing] 2025" queries

**Real-World Data:**
- Wirecutter updates all title tags with current year
- Consistently ranks for product review keywords
- CTR increases 15-25% after year updates

### 4. Use Brackets and Parentheses

**Examples:**
```html

```

**What works in brackets:**

### 5. Create Curiosity Gaps (Use Sparingly)

**Example:**
```html
<title>This SEO Mistake Cost Us $40,000 (Don't Make It)</title>
```

**Warning:** Don't be clickbait-y. The content must deliver on the promise.
