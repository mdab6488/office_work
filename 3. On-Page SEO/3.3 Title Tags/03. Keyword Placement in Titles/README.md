## Keyword Placement in Titles

### Primary Keyword Should Be in the First 50% of the Title

**❌ Bad Placement:**
```html
<title>Shop Our Amazing Selection of Professional DSLR Cameras</title>
```
Keyword "DSLR Cameras" is buried.

**✅ Good Placement:**
```html
<title>DSLR Cameras - Professional Photography Equipment | Camera Store</title>
```
Primary keyword is front-loaded.
