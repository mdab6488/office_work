## 3.1 Content Optimization



### Content Freshness

**What It Is:**
How recently your content was published or updated. Google favors fresh content for time-sensitive queries.

**Why It Matters:**
For queries like "best smartphones 2025" or "current mortgage rates," Google shows recent content. Even evergreen topics benefit from regular updates showing your content is maintained.

**Real-Life Example:**

**Query:** "Best WordPress Plugins"

❌ **Outdated (Last updated 2019):**
```
Title: "Top 10 WordPress Plugins for 2019"
Content mentions plugins that no longer exist or are unsupported
Screenshots show old WordPress dashboard design
Statistics: "WordPress powers 32% of websites" (outdated)
```

✅ **Fresh (Updated regularly):**
```
Title: "15 Best WordPress Plugins for 2025 (Tested & Ranked)"

[Update banner at top:]
"Last Updated: November 3, 2025 | We test and update this list quarterly"

Content:
- Current plugin versions with latest features
- Recent performance benchmarks
- Mentions new plugins from 2024-2025
- Updated statistics: "WordPress powers 43.5% of all websites"
- Compatibility notes: "All plugins tested with WordPress 6.4"
- Video demonstrations from 2025
```

**Real-World Impact:**
A marketing blog updated their 2020 article on "Email Marketing Statistics" with 2025 data. The page jumped from position 8 to position 2 within two weeks, and organic traffic increased 340%.

**Action Steps:**
- Add "Last Updated: [Date]" at top of articles
- Review and update top-performing posts every 6-12 months
- Replace outdated screenshots, statistics, and examples
- Add a "What's New" section for significant updates
- Use structured data to show freshness to Google
