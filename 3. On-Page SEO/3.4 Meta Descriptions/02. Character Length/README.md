## Character Length

### Optimal Length: 150-160 Characters

Google typically displays **150-160 characters** on desktop and **120-130 characters** on mobile.

**Character Count Tool:** Count every character including spaces and punctuation.

### Length Examples

**✅ Perfect Length (155 characters):**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Learn photography basics in this beginner's guide. Master exposure, composition, and camera settings with easy-to-follow tutorials and examples.">
```

**⚠️ Too Short (78 characters):**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Photography guide for beginners. Learn camera settings and techniques.">
```
Wastes valuable space that could include more keywords and benefits.

**❌ Too Long (205 characters):**
```html
<meta name="description" content="This comprehensive photography guide for beginners covers everything you need to know about cameras, lenses, exposure settings, composition techniques, lighting, post-processing, and much more to help you become a better photographer.">
```
Gets truncated to: "This comprehensive photography guide for beginners covers everything you need to know about cameras, lenses, exposure settings, composition tech..."

### Mobile Optimization

Mobile displays fewer characters (~120-130), so:

1. **Front-load important information**
2. **Make the first 120 characters compelling**
3. **Test on mobile devices**

**Example:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Get 50% off all laptops today. Free shipping, 30-day returns, and 1-year warranty. Shop Dell, HP, Lenovo, and more. Limited time offer.">
```

**Mobile Display (~130 chars):**
"Get 50% off all laptops today. Free shipping, 30-day returns, and 1-year warranty. Shop Dell, HP, Lenovo, and more. Limited time of..."

The key information (discount, free shipping, brands) appears before the cutoff.
