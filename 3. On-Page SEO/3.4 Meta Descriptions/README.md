# 3.4 Meta Descriptions

## What is a Meta Description?

A meta description is an HTML attribute that provides a brief summary of a web page. While it doesn't directly affect rankings, it significantly impacts click-through rates.

**HTML Syntax:**
```html
<head>
  <meta name="description" content="Your meta description goes here. Make it compelling and informative.">
</head>
```

**Where It Appears:**
- Below the title tag in search results
- In social media shares (if no Open Graph description)
- Sometimes in bookmark descriptions
