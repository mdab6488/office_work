## 7.7 Voice Search and Local

Voice search has fundamentally changed how people find local businesses. By 2024, over 50% of all searches are voice-based, and voice searches have a 3x higher local intent than text searches.

### Understanding Voice Search Behavior

#### Text Search vs. Voice Search

```
TEXT SEARCH:
User types: "italian restaurant boston"
└── Short, keyword-focused, no conversational tone

VOICE SEARCH:
User says: "Hey Google, where can I find a good Italian 
restaurant in Boston that's open now?"
└── Natural language, conversational, includes context
```

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Text Search | Voice Search |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Length** | 2-3 words | 7-10 words |
| **Tone** | Keyword-focused | Conversational |
| **Intent** | Research & Compare | Immediate Action |
| **Format** | Keywords | Questions |
| **Context** | Often missing | Usually included |

#### Real-Life Voice Search Examples

**Example 1: Food & Dining**
```
❌ Text: "sushi near me"
✅ Voice: "OK Google, what's the best sushi restaurant 
         near me that's open right now?"

User Intent: Ready to eat NOW, needs immediate info
Expected Result: Nearby sushi restaurants with:
├── Current open status
├── Driving/walking directions
├── Phone number to call
└── High ratings
```

**Example 2: Emergency Services**
```
❌ Text: "emergency dentist"
✅ Voice: "Hey Siri, I need an emergency dentist near me 
         who can see me today"

User Intent: Urgent need, immediate appointment
Expected Result: Dentists who:
├── Accept emergency appointments
├── Are open today
├── Have immediate availability
└── Can be called directly from results
```

**Example 3: Shopping**
```
❌ Text: "hardware store hours"
✅ Voice: "Alexa, is the Home Depot on Main Street 
         open right now?"

User Intent: Verify specific store hours before visiting
Expected Result:
├── Specific store location confirmed
├── Current open/closed status
├── Today's hours
└── Directions if open
```
