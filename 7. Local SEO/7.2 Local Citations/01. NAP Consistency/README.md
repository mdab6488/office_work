### 7.2.1 NAP Consistency (Name, Address, Phone)

#### What is NAP Consistency?

Your business name, address, and phone number must be EXACTLY the same across all online platforms.

**Why It Matters:**
- Search engines use NAP to verify business legitimacy
- Inconsistencies confuse search engines and customers
- Can result in duplicate listings
- Impacts local ranking

#### Common NAP Inconsistency Problems

**Real Example - "Madison Avenue Dental Group":**

**INCONSISTENT (Bad):**

```
Website:
Madison Avenue Dental Group
1425 Madison Ave
New York, NY 10029
(212) 555-0100

Google Business Profile:
Madison Ave. Dental Group
1425 Madison Avenue, Suite 2
New York, NY 10029
Tel: 212.555.0100

Yelp:
Madison Avenue Dental
1425 Madison Ave., 2nd Floor
New York, New York 10029
212-555-0100

HealthGrades:
Dr. Smith at Madison Dental Group
1425 Madison
NYC, NY 10029
2125550100
```

**PROBLEMS:**
- 4 different name variations
- 3 different address formats
- 3 different phone formats
- Missing/inconsistent suite number
- Abbreviated vs. full state name

**Impact on SEO:**
- Google unsure which is correct
- Citations don't reinforce each other
- Possible duplicate listing issues
- Confuses potential patients

**CONSISTENT (Good):**

```
ALL PLATFORMS:
Madison Avenue Dental Group
1425 Madison Avenue, Suite 2
New York, NY 10029
(212) 555-0100
www.madisonavedental.com
```

#### NAP Consistency Rules

**Business Name Rules:**

**✅ CORRECT:**
```
Smith & Associates Law Firm
Joe's Pizza
The Coffee Bean (if that's your legal DBA name)
```

**❌ INCORRECT:**
```
Smith & Associates Law Firm | Chicago Personal Injury Lawyers
Joe's Pizza - Best NY Style Pizza Downtown
Coffee Bean Cafe & Bakery (if legal name is just "Coffee Bean")
```

**Rules:**
- Use exact legal or DBA name
- Don't add keywords
- Don't add location unless it's in official name
- Be consistent with punctuation ("&" vs "and", hyphens, etc.)

**Address Rules:**

**Choose ONE format and use everywhere:**

**Abbreviate or Spell Out:**
```
OPTION A (Abbreviated):
123 Main St., Suite 4
Chicago, IL 60601

OPTION B (Spelled Out):
123 Main Street, Suite 4
Chicago, Illinois 60601
```

**Both are fine, just pick ONE and stick with it everywhere.**

**Common Address Elements:**

| Element | Choose One Format |
|---------|-------------------|
| Street | "St" or "Street" |
| Avenue | "Ave" or "Avenue" |
| Boulevard | "Blvd" or "Boulevard" |
| Suite | "Suite 4" or "#4" or "Ste 4" |
| Floor | "Floor 2" or "2nd Floor" or "Fl 2" |
| State | "CA" or "California" |
| Zip Code | "90210" or "90210-1234" (with +4) |

**Phone Number Rules:**

**Choose ONE format:**

```
OPTION A: (555) 123-4567
OPTION B: 555-123-4567
OPTION C: 555.123.4567
OPTION D: 5551234567
```

**Best Practice:** Use (555) 123-4567 - most common and readable.

**Rules:**
- Use local number, not toll-free (for local SEO)
- Include area code
- No extensions in NAP (add separately if needed)
- One main number consistently

#### Special NAP Situations

**Service Area Businesses (No Physical Location):**

**Example - "Clean Sweep House Cleaning":**

```
CORRECT NAP:
Clean Sweep House Cleaning
Denver, CO 80202
(303) 555-0199
```

**Rules:**
- List city/state only (no street address)
- Don't hide your address on GBP
- Show service areas clearly
- Use consistent city formatting

**Multiple Locations:**

Each location must have:
- Unique address
- Unique phone number (ideally)
- Same business name (with location if part of official name)

**Example - "Sunset Yoga Studio":**

```
LOCATION 1:
Sunset Yoga Studio - Downtown
123 Main Street
Austin, TX 78701
(512) 555-0123

LOCATION 2:
Sunset Yoga Studio - Westlake
456 Westlake Drive
Austin, TX 78746
(512) 555-0124
```

**Businesses Inside Other Businesses:**

**Example - "Dr. Sarah Chen, Dentist" (inside medical building):**

```
CORRECT:
Dr. Sarah Chen, DDS
500 Medical Plaza, Suite 204
Seattle, WA 98101
(206) 555-0145
```

**Key:** Suite/unit number differentiates from building address.
