## 7.2 Local Citations

### What Are Local Citations?

A local citation is any online mention of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP). Citations help establish credibility, improve local SEO, and make it easier for customers to find you.

**Types of Citations:**

**1. Structured Citations**
Listed in business directories with consistent formatting.

**Example - "Green Thumb Landscaping":**
```
Yelp:
Green Thumb Landscaping
123 Oak Street
Denver, CO 80202
(303) 555-0123
www.greenthumbdenver.com

YellowPages:
Green Thumb Landscaping
123 Oak Street
Denver, CO 80202
(303) 555-0123
www.greenthumbdenver.com
```

**2. Unstructured Citations**
Mentions in articles, blogs, or press releases.

**Examples:**
```
Local News Article:
"Green Thumb Landscaping of Denver recently completed a 
sustainability project at City Hall..."

Blog Post:
"I hired Green Thumb Landscaping (303-555-0123) and they did 
amazing work on our yard..."

Chamber of Commerce Article:
"Featured Member: Green Thumb Landscaping, located at 123 Oak 
Street, has been serving Denver for 20 years..."
```

**Why Citations Matter:**

**Ranking Factors:**
- Citations account for approximately 10-15% of local ranking factors
- Quality matters more than quantity
- Consistency is crucial

**Real Impact - "Harbor Pet Clinic":**
```
BEFORE Citation Building (15 citations):
- Google Maps Position: #8
- "veterinarian seattle" → Page 2
- Monthly organic calls: 23

AFTER Citation Building (85 citations):
- Google Maps Position: #3
- "veterinarian seattle" → Position #5
- Monthly organic calls: 67 (+191%)

Timeline: 6 months
Cost: $800 (mix of DIY and service)
ROI: 18 new clients/month × $200 average value = $3,600/month
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Keyword Stuffing Business Name

**❌ WRONG:**
```
Best Pizza Brooklyn NYC | Top Italian Restaurant | Pizza Delivery
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```
Giovanni's Pizzeria
```

**Why It's Bad:**
- Violates Google's guidelines
- Can get your listing suspended
- Looks spammy to customers
- Doesn't help rankings (Google penalizes this)

**Real Example of Suspension:**
A Brooklyn pizzeria added "Best Pizza Brooklyn" to their name. Google suspended their listing for 3 weeks during their busiest season, costing them an estimated $15,000 in lost revenue.

---

### Mistake #2: Inconsistent NAP

**❌ INCONSISTENT:**
```
Website: 123 Main Street, Suite 4, Denver CO 80202
Google: 123 Main St #4, Denver, Colorado 80202
Yelp: 123 Main Street, Denver, CO
Facebook: 123 Main, Denver 80202
```

**✅ CONSISTENT:**
```
ALL PLATFORMS:
123 Main Street, Suite 4
Denver, CO 80202
(303) 555-0123
```

---

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Reviews

**Common Scenario:**
```
Customer leaves 2-star review → No response
Customer leaves 1-star review → No response
(3 weeks later)
Customer leaves another negative review
Still no response

Result:
- Rating drops from 4.5 to 3.8 stars
- Clicks decrease by 40%
- Revenue drops proportionally
```

**What Should Happen:**
```
Customer leaves 2-star review
↓
Business responds within 24 hours
Apologizes, offers to make it right
Takes conversation offline
↓
Customer updates review to 4 stars
"They made it right - highly recommend!"
```

---

### Mistake #4: Selecting Wrong Categories

**❌ WRONG - "Joe's Pizza Shop":**
```
Primary Category: Restaurant (too broad)
Additional: Food, Meal Delivery (generic)
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```
Primary Category: Pizza Restaurant (specific)
Additional Categories:
- Italian Restaurant
- Pizza Delivery
- Pizza Takeaway
- Family Restaurant
```

**Impact:**
Wrong categories = Ranking for wrong searches or not ranking at all

---

### Mistake #5: Neglecting Photos

**Businesses with photos vs. without:**
- 42% more direction requests
- 35% more website clicks
- Photos viewed 91% more often than businesses without

**❌ BAD Photo Strategy:**
```
- 2 photos total
- Blurry quality
- Added 2 years ago
- No people, just building exterior
```

**✅ GOOD Photo Strategy:**
```
- 50+ photos
- High resolution
- Updated monthly
- Mix: exterior, interior, products, team, customers
- Action shots, not just static
```

---

### Mistake #6: Set It and Forget It

**Too Common:**
```
Owner creates GBP
Verifies it
Never logs in again

One year later:
- Hours are wrong (haven't updated for holidays)
- Phone number disconnected (changed 6 months ago)
- 15 unanswered reviews
- 8 unanswered questions (including "Are you still open?")
- No photos since day one
- Ranking dropped from #3 to #12
```

**Reality:**
GBP requires ongoing management, minimum 2-4 hours per month.

---

### Mistake #7: Not Using GBP Posts

**Statistics:**
- Businesses that post weekly see 50% more actions
- Posts increase engagement across all metrics
- Yet 70% of businesses never post

**Missed Opportunity Example:**
```
Restaurant doesn't post about:
- Daily specials
- Happy hour
- Live music events
- Holiday menus
- New menu items

Competitor down the street posts 3x/week about all these things
Competitor gets the customers
```

---

### Mistake #8: Fake Reviews

**❌ NEVER DO THIS:**
```
- Ask employees to leave reviews
- Pay for reviews
- Create fake accounts to review yourself
- Offer incentives for 5-star reviews specifically
- Use review services that promise "100 5-star reviews"
```

**Why It's Terrible:**
- Google will detect it (they're sophisticated)
- Your listing can be permanently suspended
- Legal ramifications (FTC violations)
- Reputation destruction
- Not worth the risk

**Real Case:**
A dental practice bought 50 fake reviews. Google detected them, removed ALL reviews (including real ones), suspended the listing for 60 days, and flagged the business. They never fully recovered their ranking.

---

### Mistake #9: Duplicate Listings

**How It Happens:**
```
Original listing created (Owner)
↓
Someone else creates another (Employee)
↓
Another created during office move (Manager)
↓
Another from old marketing company (Vendor)
↓
Now have 4 listings for same business
```

**Problems:**
- Reviews split across listings
- Confuses Google
- Confuses customers
- Dilutes ranking power

**Solution:**
- Find all duplicates
- Choose the one with most reviews
- Contact Google to merge/remove others

---

### Mistake #10: Incomplete Citations

**❌ INCOMPLETE:**
```
YellowPages:
Joe's Plumbing
123 Main St
(555) 555-5555
[End of listing]
```

**✅ COMPLETE:**
```
YellowPages:
Joe's Plumbing
123 Main Street
Denver, CO 80202
(303) 555-5555
www.joesplumbing.com
joe@joesplumbing.com

Hours: M-F 7AM-7PM, Sat 8AM-5PM, Sun Closed

Services:

- Water Heater Repair
[etc.]
