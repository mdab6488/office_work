### 7.2.3 Citation Audit

#### What is a Citation Audit?

A systematic review of all your existing citations to:
- Find inconsistencies
- Discover duplicate listings
- Identify missing citations
- Find incorrect information

**When to Audit:**
- Before building new citations
- After moving or rebranding
- If rankings suddenly drop
- Annually for maintenance

#### How to Conduct a Citation Audit

**Step 1: Discover Existing Citations**

**Manual Method:**

Google these search queries:

```
"Business Name"
"Business Name" + "City"
"Business Name" + "Phone Number"
"Phone Number"
"Address"
```

```
