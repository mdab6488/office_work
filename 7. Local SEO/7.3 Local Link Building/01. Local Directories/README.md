### 🔗 Local Directories

**What They Are:**
Local directories are online listings that catalog businesses by location and category. They serve as digital versions of phone books.

**Why They Matter:**
- Provide NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency
- Create citation signals for local search rankings
- Drive referral traffic from local searchers
- Build foundational local authority

**Real-Life Examples:**

**Example 1: Maria's Italian Restaurant in Chicago**
- Listed on: Yelp, TripAdvisor, OpenTable, Zagat, Chicago Eater
- Also submitted to: Chicago Tribune Business Directory, Choose Chicago (tourism site)
- Result: 40% increase in "Italian restaurants near me" visibility

**Example 2: GreenThumb Landscaping in Austin, TX**
- Listed on: HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, Thumbtack, Houzz
- Austin-specific: Austin Business Journal Directory, Austin Chamber of Commerce
- Result: Appeared in local pack for "Austin landscaping" within 3 months

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Identify Relevant Directories**
   - Use Moz Local or BrightLocal to find directory opportunities
   - Search "your city + business directory"
   - Check competitors' backlinks using Ahrefs/SEMrush

2. **Essential Directories to Submit To:**
   - Google Business Profile (mandatory)
   - Bing Places
   - Apple Maps
   - Yelp
   - Facebook Business
   - YellowPages
   - BBB (Better Business Bureau)

3. **Industry-Specific Directories:**
   - **Restaurants:** Zomato, OpenTable, Eater Local
   - **Hotels:** Booking.com, TripAdvisor, Hotels.com
   - **Contractors:** HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, BuildZoom
   - **Healthcare:** Healthgrades, Zocdoc, Vitals
   - **Legal:** Avvo, Justia, FindLaw

4. **Submission Best Practices:**
   - Use identical NAP information everywhere
   - Choose the most specific category available
   - Write unique descriptions (don't copy-paste)
   - Add high-quality photos
   - Include business hours, payment methods, and attributes

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Inconsistent business name (e.g., "Smith Law Firm" vs "Smith Law Firm, LLC")

- ❌ Creating duplicate listings
- ❌ Ignoring low-quality directories (they can hurt more than help)
