appointment during the heat wave."
- Mike Johnson

★★★★☆

GOOD RESPONSE:
"Thanks for your feedback, Mike! We're glad our technician could

experience. Won't be returning."
- Lisa Chen

★★☆☆☆

GOOD RESPONSE:
"Lisa, we sincerely apologize for your experience. An hour wait 
with no communication is completely unacceptable, and we take 
full responsibility. This doesn't reflect the service we strive 
to provide. I'd like to understand what happened and make this 
right. Please contact me directly at owner@harbourrestaurant.com 
or (555) 234-5678. We've implemented a new system to prevent this, 
and I'd welcome the chance to restore your faith in us."
