Google offers several verification methods:

- **Phone Verification**: Instant verification via automated call
- **Email Verification**: For some business types
- **Video Verification**: For businesses without clear signage
- **Instant Verification**: If you're verified in Google Search Console

**Real Example:**
Maria owns "Sunset Yoga Studio" in Austin, TX. She:
1. Submitted her business information
2. Chose postcard verification
3. Received the postcard in 5 days
4. Entered the verification code: "G-45821"
5. Her listing went live within 24 hours

**Common Setup Mistakes:**
- ❌ Using a PO Box address (Not allowed)
- ❌ Keyword stuffing in business name: "Best Pizza Brooklyn NYC Near Me" (Violation)
- ❌ Creating multiple listings for one location
- ✅ Correct: Use actual business name and physical address
