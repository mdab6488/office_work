## 7.6 Local Search Ranking Factors

Local search rankings are determined by Google's algorithm evaluating three primary pillars: **Proximity**, **Prominence**, and **Relevance**. Understanding and optimizing for these factors is crucial for appearing in the Local Pack (Map Pack) and local organic results.

### Understanding the Local Pack Rankings

**What is the Local Pack?**
The Local Pack (also called Map Pack or 3-Pack) is the set of three local business listings that appear in Google search results with a map. It typically shows above organic results for searches with local intent.

**Example Search Result Structure:**
```
[Search: "coffee shop near me"]
