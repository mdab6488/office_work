### 3. Relevance

**Definition:** Relevance measures how well your business matches the searcher's query. Google evaluates your business information, content, and category selections to determine if you're a good fit for what the user is searching for.

#### Components of Relevance

**1. Business Category Selection**
```
Primary Category: The most important signal!

Example: Pizza Restaurant

❌ WRONG:
Primary: Restaurant
Additional: Italian, Pizza, Food

✅ CORRECT:
Primary: Pizza Restaurant
Additional: Italian Restaurant, Pizza Delivery Service, 
           Pizza Takeaway

Why? "Pizza Restaurant" directly matches "pizza near me" searches
```

**Real-Life Example:**
```
Business: "Joe's Place"
What we sell: Pizza, sandwiches, burgers, salads

Poor Category Setup:
└── Restaurant

Better Category Setup:
├── Primary: Pizza Restaurant
└── Additional: Sandwich Shop, Hamburger Restaurant

Result: Appears for "pizza," "sandwiches," AND "burgers"
```

**2. Business Description & Attributes**

```
Example: Dental Practice

❌ GENERIC DESCRIPTION:
"We are a dental office providing quality care."

✅ OPTIMIZED DESCRIPTION:
"Brooklyn Heights family dentist offering general dentistry, 
cosmetic dentistry, teeth whitening, Invisalign, dental implants, 
and emergency dental care. Accepting new patients. Open Saturdays. 
We accept most insurance plans including Delta Dental, Cigna, 
and Aetna."

Keywords Covered:
- Brooklyn Heights dentist
- Family dentist
- Cosmetic dentistry
- Teeth whitening
- Invisalign
- Dental implants
- Emergency dentist
- Saturday dentist
```

**3. Services & Products**

```
Example: Law Firm

Google Business Profile → Services Section:

✓ Personal Injury Law
  └── "Car accident claims, slip and fall cases, 
       medical malpractice"
       
✓ Criminal Defense
  └── "DUI defense, drug charges, theft charges"
       
✓ Family Law
  └── "Divorce, child custody, spousal support"
       
✓ Estate Planning
  └── "Wills, trusts, probate"

Result: Appears for searches like:
