**Tier 2 - Important (build next):**

- Regional directories

**Resource Allocation Example:**

Small business with limited time:
- 60% effort: Google
- 30% effort: Primary industry platform
- 10% effort: Facebook

**Review Distribution Strategy:**

**What NOT to do:**
❌ Direct all customers to only Google
❌ Ignore other platforms entirely
❌ Let platforms go months without new reviews

**What TO do:**
✓ Alternate platforms in review requests
✓ Monitor all active platforms
✓ Respond on all platforms
✓ Build presence gradually across platforms

**Monthly Review Request Distribution:**
- Week 1: Google
- Week 2: Yelp/industry platform
- Week 3: Google
- Week 4: Facebook

**Platform-Specific Review Request Templates:**

**For Google:**
```
"Would you mind sharing your experience on Google? It helps 
local [City] residents find us: [link]"
```

**For Yelp:**
```
"If you're on Yelp, we'd appreciate your feedback! We're listed 
under [Business Name] in [City]."

(Note: Don't directly link or directly ask - Yelp penalizes)
```

**For TripAdvisor:**
```
"If you're planning to share your experience with other 
travelers, we're on TripAdvisor! Your review helps others 
planning their [City] trip."
```

**For Facebook:**
```
"We'd love if you could leave a review on our Facebook page! 
Many of our customers find us there: [link]"
```

**Monitoring Multiple Platforms:**

**Tools:**
- Birdeye (monitors 100+ sites)
- GatherUp (Google, Facebook, industry sites)
- ReviewTrackers (150+ sites)
- Grade.us (major platforms)

**DIY Approach:**
- Create spreadsheet with all profile links
- Set calendar reminders (daily for Google, weekly for others)
- Enable email notifications where possible
- Check dashboard weekly

**Dealing with Platform-Specific Issues:**

### **Yelp's Filter:**
**Problem:** Yelp filters 20-25% of reviews

**What Gets Filtered:**
- Reviews from accounts with no other reviews
- First review on a new account
- Reviews from accounts with few friends/photos
- Suspicious patterns

**What You Can Do:**
- Accept it (filtered reviews still count partially)
- Encourage active Yelp users to review
- NEVER ask Yelp to unfilter
- Focus on quality over quantity

### **Google Review Removal:**
**Problem:** Google removes reviews that violate policy

**Removable Reviews:**
- Spam or fake
- Off-topic
- Conflict of interest
- Illegal content
- Sexually explicit
- Personal attacks

**How to Request Removal:**
- Flag through Google Business Profile
- Provide evidence if available
- Be patient (can take weeks)

### **Facebook Review Removal:**
**Problem:** Can't remove negative reviews

**What You Can Do:**
- Respond professionally
- Use private response feature
- Report if violates Facebook policies
- Overwhelm with positive reviews

**Review Platform Costs:**

**Free Platforms:**
- Google Business Profile
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Industry platforms (basic listings)

**Paid Options:**
- Yelp Ads: $200-1,000/month
- BBB Accreditation: $200-10,000/year
- Healthgrades Premium: $200-400/month
- HomeAdvisor Leads: Pay per lead ($15-80 each)
- Avvo Pro: $79/month

**ROI Tracking By Platform:**

Track separately for each:
```
Google Reviews:
- Views: 15,000/month
- Calls: 200
- Conversion: 40 customers
- Revenue: $30,000
- ROI: High (free platform)

Yelp Reviews:
- Views: 800/month
- Calls: 15
- Conversion: 3 customers
- Revenue: $2,250
- Cost: $300/month
- ROI: 7.5x (worth continuing)
```

**Advanced: Review Funnel Strategy:**

**Internal Feedback First:**
1. Customer completes service
2. Send satisfaction survey privately
3. If positive (4-5 stars) → Direct to public review
4. If negative (1-3 stars) → Internal complaint form

**Example Flow:**
```
Email 1 (same day):
"How did we do? [Rate 1-5 stars]"

If 5 stars:
"We're thrilled! Would you share on Google? [link]"

If 1-3 stars:
"We're sorry we missed the mark. Please tell us what happened 
so we can make it right: [link to private form]"
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces public negative reviews
- Gives chance to fix issues before they go public
- Increases positive review rate

**Important:** Don't ONLY ask happy customers for public reviews and unhappy customers for private feedback - that can violate platform policies. Must be transparent about process.
