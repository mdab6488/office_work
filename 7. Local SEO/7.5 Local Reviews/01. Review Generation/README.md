### ⭐ Review Generation

**What It Is:**
Proactively asking satisfied customers to leave reviews on various platforms.

**Why It Matters:**
- Reviews are a top-3 local ranking factor
- 93% of consumers read reviews before buying
- Businesses with 25+ reviews see 108% more clicks
- Review velocity (new reviews) signals active business
- Reviews include keywords that help rankings

**Real-Life Examples:**

**Example 1: Dental Practice - QR Code Strategy**

**Implementation:**
- Printed business cards with QR code linking to Google review page
- Handed card after successful appointment
- Said: "We'd love your feedback if you had a great experience today"

**Results:**
- Reviews increased from 2-3/month to 15-20/month
- Average rating improved from 4.2 to 4.8 stars
- Appeared in local pack for 12 new search terms
- Phone calls increased 35%
- Conversion rate: 30% of cards resulted in reviews

**Example 2: Restaurant - Post-Meal Tablet**

**Implementation:**
- Server brings tablet with bill
- Tablet shows: "How was your meal?" with smiley face scale
- If customer selects 4-5 stars, tablet shows: "Would you share on Google?"
- Direct link to Google review page

**Results:**
- 50% of happy customers left reviews
- Review count went from 80 to 350 in 6 months
- Became #1 rated restaurant in category
- Reservations increased 60%
- Protected against occasional negative review (ratio stayed strong)

**Example 3: Plumbing Company - Email Sequence**

**Implementation:**
Email 1 (same day as service):
"Thanks for choosing us! Was [Technician Name] helpful?"

Email 2 (if positive response, 2 days later):
"We're so glad [Technician] took great care of you! Would you mind sharing your experience on Google? It helps local homeowners find reliable service. [Direct Link]"

Email 3 (if no action, 5 days later):
"P.S. We'd love your review when you have 30 seconds. [Link]"

**Results:**
- 20% email-to-review conversion rate
- Went from 15 reviews to 200 reviews in 1 year
- Review mentions specific technicians by name (great for morale)
- Ranked #1 for "plumber [city]"
- Booking rate increased from 15% to 32%

**Effective Review Request Strategies:**

**1. Timing Is Everything**

**Best times to ask:**
- ✓ Immediately after positive interaction
- ✓ Right after problem resolution
- ✓ When customer expresses gratitude
- ✓ After milestone completion (project finished)

**Worst times to ask:**
- ✗ During active complaint/issue
- ✗ Weeks/months after service
- ✗ Before service is fully complete
- ✗ Repeatedly to same customer

**2. Make It Effortless**

**Easy methods:**
- QR code directly to review platform
- Text message with direct link
- Email with one-click access
- Tablet/iPad in-person
- NFC tag (tap phone to leave review)

**Hard methods (avoid):**
- "Go to Google and search for us, then..."
- Requiring login/account creation
- Multiple steps or unclear process

**3. Personalize The Request**

**Generic (weak):**
"Please leave us a review"

**Personalized (effective):**
"Hi Sarah, thanks for trusting us with your kitchen remodel! Would you mind sharing your experience? It really helps other homeowners in [City] make confident decisions."

**4. Ask Face-to-Face (Most Effective)**

**Script template:**
"I'm so glad everything went well today! We're a local business, and online reviews really help neighbors find us. If you have 30 seconds, would you mind sharing your experience on Google?"

**Hand them:**
- Business card with QR code
- OR pull out tablet/phone and offer to pull it up
- OR text them the link right there

**Success rate: 40-60% when asked in person vs 5-15% via email**

**5. Incentive Guidelines (Be Careful)**

**Allowed:**
- Entering reviewers in drawing/raffle for prize
- General customer appreciation (not tied to reviews)
- Thanking customers who leave reviews (not beforehand)

**Prohibited:**
- Paying for reviews
- Discounts in exchange for reviews
- Asking for positive reviews specifically
- Incentivizing only 5-star reviews

**Safe approach:**
"Everyone who reviews us this month enters our drawing for a $100 gift card"
(Important: All reviewers, regardless of star rating)

**Review Request Templates:**

**In-Person Script:**
```
"We're so glad we could help you today! As a local business, 
online reviews really help neighbors in [City] find us. Would 
you mind taking 30 seconds to share your experience on Google?"

[Hand QR code card or show phone]

"No pressure at all - we just appreciate your time today!"
```

**Text Message:**
```

your feedback if you have 30 seconds: [link]

service. Thanks again!

**Review Generation System:**

**Step 1: Identify Happy Customers**
Create internal system to flag:
- 5-star service experiences
- Customers who give verbal praise
- Successful project completions
- Repeat customers

**Step 2: Ask at Peak Satisfaction**
Build into workflow:
- Receptionist asks after appointment
- Technician asks after fixing problem
- Automated email after delivery
- Manager follows up on major projects

**Step 3: Provide Direct Links**
Create links for each platform:
- Google: Use "Place ID" to create direct review link
- Facebook: Use your page's review link
- Yelp: Profile review link
- Industry-specific: Direct URLs

**Tool:** Use a link shortener (bit.ly) for cleaner links
Example: yourbusiness.com/review redirects to Google

**Step 4: Follow Up (Once)**
If customer doesn't review:
- One follow-up reminder after 3-5 days
- Different channel (text then email, or vice versa)
- No additional pressure after second ask

**Step 5: Track & Analyze**
Monitor:
- Which staff members generate most reviews
- Which request method works best
- Timing correlation (same day vs. next day)
- Conversion rate by service type

**Review Generation Mistakes to Avoid:**

❌ **Asking Everyone Indiscriminately**
Only ask customers who had genuinely positive experiences

❌ **Being Too Pushy**
One in-person ask + one follow-up maximum

❌ **Incentivizing Positive Reviews Only**
Must be neutral: "Leave a review" not "Leave a 5-star review"

❌ **Cherry-Picking Platforms**
Don't only ask happy customers for Google and unhappy for less visible sites

❌ **Forgetting to Say Thank You**
Always acknowledge reviews (covered in next section)

❌ **Faking Reviews**
Never create fake reviews, ask family without disclosure, or use review services
Google can detect and will penalize

**Review Generation Goals:**

**New Business (0-10 reviews):**
- Goal: 25 reviews in first 6 months
- Focus: Just Google initially
- Strategy: Ask every single satisfied customer

**Established (10-50 reviews):**
- Goal: 3-5 new reviews per month
- Focus: Google + 1-2 industry platforms
- Strategy: Systematic ask at point of satisfaction

**Mature (50+ reviews):**
- Goal: Maintain consistent flow (5-10/month)
- Focus: Multiple platforms for diversity
- Strategy: Automated systems + personal asks for VIPs
