### 1.6 Goal Setting

#### Types of Goals

**GA4 doesn't use "Goals" like Universal Analytics. Instead, use "Conversions" (marked events) and "Key Events"**

**Categories of Key Events:**

```plaintext
1. Destination Goals
   - Thank you page reached
   - Example: /thank-you-for-subscribing

2. Duration Goals
   - Time on site threshold
   - Example: 3+ minutes engaged

3. Pages/Session Goals
   - Multiple page visits
   - Example: 4+ pages viewed

4. Event Goals
   - Specific action completed
   - Example: Video watched 50%

5. Monetary Goals
   - Revenue threshold
   - Example: Order value >$100
```

#### Creating Smart Goals

**SMART Goal Framework:**

```plaintext
S - Specific     (Clear and well-defined)
M - Measurable   (Quantifiable)
A - Achievable   (Realistic given resources)
R - Relevant     (Aligned with business objectives)
T - Time-bound   (Specific deadline)
```

**Real-Life Goal Examples:**

```plaintext
❌ BAD GOAL:
"Get more traffic"

✅ GOOD GOAL:
"Increase organic traffic from 10,000 to 15,000 monthly sessions 
within Q2 2024, focusing on long-tail keywords in the 'digital 
marketing' category, resulting in 50 additional qualified leads."

Breakdown:
- Specific: Organic traffic, long-tail keywords, digital marketing
- Measurable: 10,000 → 15,000 sessions, 50 leads
- Achievable: 50% increase over 3 months
- Relevant: More qualified leads = business growth
- Time-bound: Q2 2024 (3-month window)
```
