### 5. Time on Site

**Definition:** The average amount of time visitors spend on your website during a session.

**Also Known As:**
- Average Session Duration
- Average Engagement Time (in GA4)
- Dwell Time (in SEO context)

**Why It Matters:**
- Indicates content quality and relevance
- Google uses dwell time as a ranking factor
- Longer time = more engaged audience = higher conversion potential
- Shows if your content satisfies user intent

**Benchmarks by Content Type:**

| Content Type | Good Time on Site | Average | Poor |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|------|
| Long-form blog (2000+ words) | 5-10 minutes | 2-5 minutes | <2 minutes |
| Product pages | 2-4 minutes | 1-2 minutes | <1 minute |
| Home page | 1-3 minutes | 30s-1min | <30 seconds |
| Video content page | 3-8 minutes | 1-3 minutes | <1 minute |
| Tool/Calculator pages | 3-6 minutes | 1-3 minutes | <1 minute |

**How to Measure:**
- **Google Analytics 4:** Reports → Engagement → Average engagement time
