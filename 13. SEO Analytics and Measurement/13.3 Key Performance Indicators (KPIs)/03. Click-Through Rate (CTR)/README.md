### 3. Click-Through Rate (CTR)

**Definition:** The percentage of people who see your listing in search results and actually click on it.

**Formula:**
```
CTR = (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100

Example:
- Your page appeared 1,000 times in search results (impressions)
- 50 people clicked on it (clicks)
- CTR = (50 ÷ 1,000) × 100 = 5%
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Shows how compelling your titles and descriptions are
- Google uses CTR as a ranking signal
- Higher CTR = more traffic without ranking higher
- Reveals disconnect between rankings and actual traffic

**Expected CTR by Position:**

| Position | Average CTR | Example (1,000 impressions) |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| #1 | 28-32% | 280-320 clicks |
| #2 | 15-20% | 150-200 clicks |
| #3 | 10-12% | 100-120 clicks |
| #4 | 7-9% | 70-90 clicks |
| #5 | 5-7% | 50-70 clicks |
| #6-10 | 2-5% | 20-50 clicks |

**How to Measure:**
- **Google Search Console:** Performance report → Pages or Queries → CTR column

**Real-Life Example:**

**Case Study: Online Recipe Blog**

**Problem Identified:**
```
Page: "Easy Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe"
Average Position: #4
Impressions: 12,000/month
Clicks: 600/month

```

**Diagnosis:** Title and meta description weren't compelling enough.

**Original Title & Description:**
```
Title: "Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe"
Meta: "Learn how to make chocolate chip cookies. This recipe is easy."
```

**Optimized Title & Description:**
```
Title: "Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies (Ready in 20 Minutes!) | Tested Recipe"
Meta: "The BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe—crispy edges, chewy centers, 
       loaded with chocolate. No mixer needed! ⭐ 2,847 five-star reviews."
```

**Results After 1 Month:**
```
Average Position: #4 (same)
Impressions: 12,000/month (same)
Clicks: 1,080/month
CTR: 9% (80% improvement!)
Additional traffic: 480 visitors/month with NO ranking change
```
