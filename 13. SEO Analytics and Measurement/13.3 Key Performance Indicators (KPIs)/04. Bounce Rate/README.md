### 4. Bounce Rate

**Definition:** The percentage of visitors who leave your website after viewing only one page without taking any action.

**Formula:**
```
Bounce Rate = (Single-page sessions ÷ Total sessions) × 100
```

**Why It Matters:**
- Indicates content relevance and quality
- High bounce rate may signal poor user experience
- Google uses engagement metrics as ranking factors
- Affects conversion rates directly

**Bounce Rate Benchmarks by Industry:**

| Industry | Good Bounce Rate | Average | Poor |
|----------|------------------|---------|------|
| E-commerce | 20-45% | 45-65% | 65%+ |
| Lead Generation | 30-50% | 50-70% | 70%+ |
| Content/Blogs | 40-60% | 60-80% | 80%+ |
| Service Sites | 30-55% | 55-75% | 75%+ |
| Landing Pages | 60-90% | (varies greatly by intent) |

**How to Measure:**
- **Google Analytics 4:** Reports → Engagement → Pages and screens → Bounce rate column
- **Alternative in GA4:** Look at "Engaged sessions" (opposite of bounces)

**Real-Life Example:**

```

**Bounce Rate Context Matters:**

**When High Bounce Rate is OK:**
```
✅ Contact page (user found phone number and called)
✅ Store hours page (user got info and visited)
✅ Recipe page (user got recipe and left to cook)
✅ "Near me" searches (user got address and left)
```

**When High Bounce Rate is BAD:**
```
❌ Product pages (should add to cart or view more products)
❌ Blog posts (should read related articles)
❌ Home page (should navigate to other pages)
❌ Service pages (should contact or learn more)
```

**Bounce Rate Reduction Tactics:**

**1. Improve Page Load Speed:**
```
Target: <2 seconds on mobile
- Every 1-second delay = 7% reduction in conversions
```

**2. Match Search Intent:**
```
If ranking for "best running shoes 2024":
✅ Show a list of reviewed shoes
❌ Write an essay about running history
```

**3. Add Internal Links:**
```
Every page should have 3-5 contextual links to related content
Example in article: "Before we discuss X, make sure you understand 
[the basics of Y](link)"
```

**4. Use Exit-Intent Popups:**
```
Offer something valuable when users try to leave:
- Free ebook download
- Discount code
- Newsletter with exclusive tips
```

**5. Improve Visual Hierarchy:**
```
✅ Clear headlines
✅ Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
✅ Bullet points and lists
✅ Images and videos
✅ White space
```

**6. Add Engagement Elements:**
```
✅ Videos (embedded YouTube or native)
✅ Calculators or tools
✅ Quizzes or assessments
✅ Comment sections
✅ Social share buttons
```
