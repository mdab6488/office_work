## Title Tag Testing

### Why Test Title Tags?

Title tags are one of the most critical ranking factors and the primary element users see in search results. Small changes can have significant impacts.

### What to Test

1. **Length variations**
2. **Keyword placement**
3. **Brand positioning**
4. **Emotional triggers**
5. **Numbers and brackets**
6. **Power words**

### Real-Life Example 1: SaaS Company Blog

**Company:** Project management tool
**Pages:** 200 blog articles about productivity

**Hypothesis:** Adding year in title tags will improve CTR for "how-to" articles

```
Control Group (100 articles):
"How to Manage Remote Teams Effectively"

Variant Group (100 articles):
"How to Manage Remote Teams Effectively [2025 Guide]"

Results (8 weeks):
- Variant CTR: +18%
- Variant organic traffic: +12%
- Average position: Improved from 7.2 to 5.8
```

**Implementation:**
```html
<!-- Control -->
<title>How to Manage Remote Teams Effectively | ProjectPro</title>

<!-- Variant -->
<title>How to Manage Remote Teams Effectively [2025 Guide] | ProjectPro</title>
```

### Real-Life Example 2: Local Service Business

**Company:** Plumbing service in multiple cities
**Pages:** 50 location pages

**Hypothesis:** Moving location to the front of title tags improves local rankings

```
Control Group (25 pages):
"Emergency Plumbing Services | Chicago | FastPlumbers"

Variant Group (25 pages):
"Chicago Emergency Plumbing Services | FastPlumbers | 24/7"

Results (6 weeks):
- Variant: +31% organic traffic
- Variant: +2.3 positions average improvement
- Variant: +27% phone calls from organic search
```

### Real-Life Example 3: News Publisher

**Company:** Technology news website
**Pages:** 500 news articles

**Hypothesis:** Removing brand name from title tags gives more space for keywords

```
Control Group (250 articles):
"Apple Announces New iPhone Features | TechDaily News"
(52 characters)

Variant Group (250 articles):
"Apple Announces Revolutionary iPhone Camera and AI Features"
(60 characters - more descriptive, no brand)

Results (10 weeks):
- Variant: +8% CTR
- Control: Better brand recognition
- Decision: Hybrid approach - keep brand on competitive keywords
```

Step 4: Monitor Metrics
- Organic traffic
- Click-through rate
- Average position
