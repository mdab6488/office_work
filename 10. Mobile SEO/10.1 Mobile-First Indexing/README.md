## 10. Mobile SEO

Mobile SEO is the practice of optimizing your website for users on smartphones and tablets. With over 60% of searches now happening on mobile devices, mobile optimization is no longer optional—it's critical for success.

**Why Mobile SEO Matters:**
- Google uses mobile-first indexing (mobile version is the primary version)
- Mobile users have different behaviors and needs than desktop users
- Page experience is a ranking factor, and mobile performance heavily influences it
- Poor mobile experience = high bounce rates = lost conversions
