## Market Share Analysis {#market-share}

### 1. Share of Voice (SOV) Analysis

**Definition:** Share of Voice represents your brand's visibility compared to competitors across target keywords.

**Formula:**
```
SOV = (Your Ranking Appearances / Total Ranking Appearances) × 100

Example:
Your rankings: 2,450 keywords in top 10
Competitor A: 3,200 keywords
Competitor B: 1,890 keywords
Competitor C: 2,100 keywords
Total: 9,640 keywords

Your SOV = (2,450 / 9,640) × 100 = 25.4%
```

#### Step-by-Step SOV Analysis

**Step 1: Define Keyword Universe**

```
Example: Cloud Storage Provider

Keyword Categories:

│
├── Competitor Brand Terms (600 keywords)
│   └── "dropbox alternative", "google drive vs"
│
└── Industry Terms (1,000 keywords)
    └── "cloud computing trends", "data security"

Total Keyword Universe: 7,000 keywords
```

**Step 2: Track Rankings Across Universe**

### 4. Content Gap Analysis

**Definition:** Identifying topics where competitors rank but you don't, representing missed opportunities.

**Process:**

```
Content Gap Identification Workflow

Step 1: Export Competitor Keywords

Example: AI-powered tools, no-code solutions
```

#### Real-World Example: E-commerce Pet Supplies

**Competitive Mapping Project:**

```
Company: Online Pet Supply Retailer
Market: US Pet Supplies ($45B annual market)
Goal: Map complete competitive landscape for strategic planning

Step 1: Identify All Competitor Types

Direct E-commerce Competitors:
┌──────────────┬──────────────┬────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Competitor   │ Est. Traffic │ Market     │ Strengths   │
├──────────────┼──────────────┼────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Chewy        │ 45M/month    │ 18% share  │ Brand, CX   │
│ Petco.com    │ 12M/month    │ 6% share   │ Stores+Web  │
│ PetSmart.com │ 10M/month    │ 5% share   │ Stores+Web  │
│ Amazon Pets  │ 89M/month    │ 35% share  │ Everything  │
│ Your Company │ 2.4M/month   │ 1.2% share │ Specialty   │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────┴─────────────┘

Indirect Competitors:
├── Walmart.com (pet section): 8M pet visits/month
├── Target.com (pet section): 4.5M pet visits/month
├── Subscription boxes (BarkBox, etc.): 3.2M combined
├── Specialty stores (aquarium, reptile): 2.1M combined
└── Local pet stores: Offline competition

SERP Competitors (Not Business Competitors):
├── PetMD.com: 8.9M/month (pet care info)
├── American Kennel Club: 6.2M/month (breed info)
├── Rover.com: 4.1M/month (services, some content)
├── Reddit r/dogs, r/cats: 2.8M/month (community)
├── YouTube pet channels: 15M+ monthly (education)
└── Pet blogs/influencers: 12M+ combined

Emerging Threats:
├── Farmer's Dog (fresh food): +340% YoY growth
├── TikTok Shop (pet products): Explosive growth
├── Chewy's content expansion: Moving into your territory
├── AI pet care apps: New category emerging
└── DTC pet food brands: Growing rapidly

Step 2: Keyword Overlap Analysis

Shared Keyword Analysis:
Total target universe: 15,000 pet-related keywords

Keyword Overlap with Top Competitors:
├── Chewy: 8,900 shared keywords (59%)
├── Amazon: 12,400 shared keywords (83%)
├── Petco: 6,700 shared keywords (45%)
├── PetMD: 2,100 shared keywords (14%)
└── Rover: 890 shared keywords (6%)

Your Unique Keywords (Low competition):
├── 1,200 specialty/niche keywords
├── Example: "exotic bird supplies", "saltwater aquarium"
├── Opportunity: Strong position in specialties
└── Strategy: Double down on niches

Competitor-Only Keywords (You're missing):
├── 4,500 keywords where competitors rank, you don't
├── High-value examples:
│   ├── "best dog food" (Chewy #1, you #47)
│   ├── "cat litter boxes" (Amazon #1, you #23)
│   ├── "puppy training tips" (PetMD #1, you not ranking)
│   └── "dog breeds" (AKC #1, you not ranking)
└── Gap Value: ~$12M annual revenue opportunity

Step 3: Strategic Group Mapping

Map competitors by two dimensions:
- X-axis: Product Range (Narrow to Wide)
- Y-axis: Content Depth (Minimal to Extensive)

Strategic Groups Identified:

Group 1: Mass Market Giants
├── Amazon, Walmart, Target
├── Characteristics:
│   ├── Extremely wide product range
│   ├── Minimal pet-specific content
│   ├── Low prices
│   ├── Convenience-focused
│   └── Generic pet category
├── Strength: Scale, price, convenience
├── Weakness: No expertise, generic
└── Your competitive angle: Beat them on expertise

Group 2: Pet Specialty Retailers
├── Chewy, Petco, PetSmart, You
├── Characteristics:
│   ├── Wide pet product range
│   ├── Growing content operations
│   ├── Customer service focus
│   ├── Pet-specific expertise
│   └── Community building
├── Strength: Pet focus, better service
├── Weakness: Can't match Amazon's price/convenience
└── Your competitive angle: Deeper specialty knowledge

Group 3: Information Publishers
├── PetMD, AKC, pet bloggers
├── Characteristics:
│   ├── Deep, extensive content
│   ├── Limited or no e-commerce
│   ├── Monetize via ads/affiliates
│   ├── Strong topical authority
│   └── High organic visibility
├── Strength: Content depth, authority, rankings
├── Weakness: Don't sell directly
└── Your competitive angle: Content + Commerce

Group 4: Niche Specialists
├── Specialty stores (aquarium, reptile, bird)
├── Characteristics:
│   ├── Narrow product focus
│   ├── Deep category expertise
│   ├── Loyal niche audience
│   ├── Premium pricing
│   └── Limited growth potential
├── Strength: Category authority
├── Weakness: Limited scope
└── Your opportunity: Multiple niches under one roof

Strategic Positioning Decision:

Your Optimal Position:
"Multi-Niche Specialist with Content Authority"

├── Not competing head-to-head with Amazon (can't win on price)
├── Not trying to beat Chewy at mass-market pets (expensive)
├── Instead: Dominate 5-7 specialty categories
│   ├── Exotic birds
│   ├── Saltwater aquariums
│   ├── Reptiles & amphibians
│   ├── Small animals (rabbits, guinea pigs)
│   ├── Premium/organic pet food
│   └── Senior pet care
│   └── Special needs pets
│
└── Build content authority in each niche
    ├── Deeper than PetMD in your niches
    ├── More actionable than generalists
    ├── Community building per niche
    └── Expert partnerships

Step 4: Competitive Threat Assessment

Threat Matrix:
┌────────────────┬──────────┬────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Competitor     │ Threat   │ Timeline   │ Response    │
├────────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Chewy Content  │ HIGH     │ Immediate  │ Accelerate  │
│ TikTok Shop    │ MEDIUM   │ 6-12 mo    │ Monitor     │
│ Amazon Pets    │ MEDIUM   │ Ongoing    │ Avoid       │
│ DTC Brands     │ LOW      │ 12-24 mo   │ Partner     │
└────────────────┴──────────┴────────────┴─────────────┘

High Threat Analysis: Chewy's Content Expansion

Intelligence Gathered:
├── Chewy published 450 new articles in 2024
├── Hired editorial team of 15+ writers
├── Investing heavily in video content
├── Topics: Pet care, training, health, breeds
├── Traffic growth: +180% YoY in content section
├── Strategy: Become pet care destination, not just store
└── Risk: Will capture traffic you need

Defensive Strategy:
├── Niche deeper than they can
├── Move faster in specialty categories
├── Build expert authority they lack
├── Create community features
└── Differentiate on expertise depth
```
