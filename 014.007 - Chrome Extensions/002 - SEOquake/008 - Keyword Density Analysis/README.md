Frequency of specific words/phrases on a page as percentage of total words

**Optimal Range**: 1-3% for primary keywords

2. "marketing" - 76 occurrences (3.04%)
3. "strategy" - 45 occurrences (1.80%)
4. "business" - 38 occurrences (1.52%)

⚠️ Single word "content" at 3.48% (slightly high, but acceptable)
✅ Good variety of related terms (strategy, audience, business)
✅ Natural language (not keyword stuffing)
✅ LSI keywords present (target audience, social media)
```

### Optimization Strategy Based on Density

**Example 1: Keyword Stuffing Detected**
```
Page: "Best Running Shoes"

Density Results:
❌ "running shoes" - 89 occurrences (4.5%)
❌ "best running shoes" - 67 occurrences (3.4%)
❌ "running" - 112 occurrences (5.6%)

Problems:
- Keyword density too high
- Unnatural repetition
- Risk of penalty

Solution:
1. Replace repetitive phrases with pronouns:
   "These shoes" instead of "running shoes"
   
2. Use synonyms:
   - "athletic footwear"
   - "training shoes"
   - "sneakers"
   
3. Focus on natural, helpful content
4. Rewrite to 1.5-2.5% density
```

**Example 2: Under-Optimized Content**
```
Page: "Email Marketing Guide"

Density Results:
⚠️ "email marketing" - 12 occurrences (0.6%)
⚠️ "email" - 28 occurrences (1.4%)
⚠️ "marketing" - 22 occurrences (1.1%)

Problems:
- Main keyword under-represented
- Missing topic clarity
- Competitors likely have better optimization

Solution:
1. Increase natural mentions in:
   - Introduction (2-3 times)
   - H2 headings (2-3 times)
   - Conclusion (1-2 times)
   - Throughout body naturally
   
2. Target: 1.5-2% density
3. Add related terms:
   - "email campaign"
   - "email list"
   - "email subscribers"
```
