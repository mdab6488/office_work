- Spam 21-30% = 1 point
- Spam 30%+   = -5 points

- Relevant niche = 5 points
- Related niche  = 3 points
- Unrelated     = 0 points

Example:
site-a.com
DA: 65 (7 points)
Spam: 8% (5 points)
Relevance: High (5 points)
Total: 17 points → Priority outreach

DA: 50 | PA: 45 → Ratio: 90% ✓ Healthy

Site B:
DA: 60 | PA: 32 → Ratio: 53% ⚠ Under-optimized
→ Page not leveraging site authority
→ Opportunity: Improve on-page, add internal links

Site C:
DA: 30 | PA: 48 → Ratio: 160% ⚠ Unusual
→ Page over-performing relative to domain
→ Strong page-specific backlinks
→ Good candidate for additional promotion

Your Use:
→ Find high-DA, low-PA pages on your site
→ These can improve with optimization
→ Quick wins for rankings
```

### Tip 8: Local SEO Validation

```
Verify Local Rankings:

1. Set location in MozBar
   Settings → Location → "Chicago, IL"

2. Search: "best pizza near me"

3. Check results:
   - Local businesses show DA 15-35
   - These compete despite lower DA
   - Local signals override authority

4. Your local business (DA 22):
   → Can compete with big brands locally
   → Focus on local SEO factors
   → Don't be intimidated by national sites
```

### Tip 9: Content Refresh Priority

```
Find Pages to Update:

1. Search: site:yoursite.com
2. Sort by date (older first)
3. Check PA with MozBar

Old, High-PA Pages to Update:

/guide-2020 → PA 52 → 4 years old
→ Priority refresh! Has authority + outdated

/resource-2022 → PA 48 → 2 years old
→ Medium priority

/recent-post → PA 28 → New
→ Low priority, focus on promotion

Strategy:
→ Update high-PA old content first
→ Leverage existing authority
→ Update stats, examples, year
→ Re-promote updated content
```

### Tip 10: Spam Score Verification

```
Don't Trust Spam Score Alone:

Site shows Spam Score: 45%

Investigate:
1. Use MozBar link analysis
2. Check outbound links:
   - Are they spammy?
   - Or legitimate?

3. Check content quality:
   - Well-written?
   - Valuable information?
   - Or thin/duplicate?

4. Check for:
   - Excessive ads
   - Broken links
   - Malicious redirects

Result:
→ Spam score may be false positive
→ Use human judgment
→ Combine with manual review
→ Don't auto-reject based on score
```
