### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue 1: MozBar Not Showing Metrics**

```
Symptoms:
- Toolbar appears but shows "---" for DA/PA
- No metrics on SERP
- Extension appears inactive

Solutions:

1. Login Required
   → Click MozBar icon
   → Login to your Moz account
   → Metrics should appear

2. API Limit Reached
   → Free accounts have daily limits
   → Wait 24 hours
   → Or upgrade to Moz Pro

3. Page Not in Index
   → Very new sites may not have metrics
   → Brand new pages won't have PA
   → Wait for Moz to crawl

4. Extension Conflict
   → Disable other SEO extensions
   → Refresh page
   → Re-enable one at a time to find conflict
```

**Issue 2: Inaccurate or Outdated Metrics**

```
Why Metrics May Be Wrong:

1. Recent Algorithm Updates
   - Moz updates monthly
   - DA/PA can fluctuate
   - Wait for next update

2. Link Profile Changes
   - Recent link gains/losses
   - Not yet reflected in metrics
   - Check Moz Link Explorer for latest

3. New Website
   - Takes time to establish DA
   - New sites start at DA 1
   - Build links to increase

Solution:
→ Use as relative comparison, not absolute truth
→ Supplement with other tools
→ Focus on trends, not single numbers
```

**Issue 3: SERP Overlay Not Working**

```
Problem: MozBar not showing on Google results

Fixes:

1. Activate MozBar
   → Click icon to turn on
   → Should turn blue when active

2. Clear Cache
   → Chrome Settings
   → Clear browsing data
   → Reload Google

3. Check Google Domain
   → Works on google.com
   → May not work on country-specific domains
   → Switch to google.com

4. Reinstall Extension
   → Remove MozBar
   → Restart browser
   → Reinstall from Chrome Store
```

**Issue 4: Slow Page Loading**

```
Problem: Pages load slowly with MozBar active

Solutions:

1. Disable When Not Needed
   → Turn off MozBar by default
   → Only activate when analyzing
   → Saves resources

2. Reduce Features
   → Settings → Disable auto-features
   → Turn off keyword highlighting
   → Manual activation only

3. Browser Optimization
   → Close unused tabs
   → Clear cache regularly
   → Update Chrome to latest version

4. Upgrade Internet
   → MozBar makes API calls
   → Requires decent connection
   → Use wired connection when possible
```

**Issue 5: Link Analysis Shows No Data**

```
Problem: Link analysis returns empty or minimal results

Reasons:

1. Free vs Premium
   → Free version has limited link data
   → Upgrade to Moz Pro for full access
   → Or use Moz Link Explorer (web)

2. Private/New Site
   → Site may block crawlers
   → Very new sites lack data
   → Wait for Moz to crawl

3. No Links Detected
   → Page genuinely has few links
   → Not an error
   → Use page search to verify

Solution:
→ Use Link Explorer for comprehensive data
→ MozBar best for quick checks
→ Combine with other tools
```
