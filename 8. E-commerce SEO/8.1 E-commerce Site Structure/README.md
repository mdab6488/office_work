A well-organized site structure helps search engines crawl your site efficiently and helps users find products easily.

### 🏗️ Ideal E-commerce Site Structure

```
Homepage
    ├── Category Page (e.g., Men's Clothing)
    │   ├── Subcategory Page (e.g., Men's Shirts)
    │   │   ├── Product Page (Blue Oxford Shirt)
    │   │   ├── Product Page (White T-Shirt)
    │   │   └── Product Page (Black Polo)
    │   └── Subcategory Page (e.g., Men's Pants)
    ├── Category Page (e.g., Women's Clothing)
    └── Category Page (e.g., Accessories)
```

**Key Principles:**
