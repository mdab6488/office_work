### 📂 Category Pages

Category pages are the backbone of e-commerce SEO. They target high-volume, competitive keywords and guide users to products.

#### Real-Life Example: Amazon

**URL Structure:**
```
amazon.com/electronics/computers-accessories/laptops
```

**Key Elements:**

1. **Descriptive H1 Tag**
```html
<h1>Laptops & Notebooks</h1>
```

2. **Unique Category Description** (300-500 words)
Amazon places descriptive text at the bottom of category pages:
```
"Shop for laptops from top brands like Dell, HP, Apple, and Lenovo. 
Find gaming laptops, business laptops, 2-in-1 convertibles, and more. 
Compare features, prices, and customer reviews to find your perfect laptop."
```

3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**
```html
<nav aria-label="breadcrumb">
  Electronics > Computers & Accessories > Laptops
</nav>
```

4. **Filters and Sorting Options**
- Brand
- Price range
- Screen size
- Processor type
- Customer ratings

5. **Product Grid with Key Information**
- Product image
- Product title
- Price
- Rating/reviews
- Quick "Add to Cart" option

#### Best Practices for Category Pages

✅ **DO:**
- Write unique content for each category (avoid duplicate descriptions)
- Include target keywords naturally in H1, description, and meta tags
- Add subcategory links for better navigation
- Display 20-40 products per page (balance UX and SEO)
- Use pagination or "Load More" instead of infinite scroll
- Include FAQ section targeting long-tail keywords

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use manufacturer-provided descriptions (duplicate content)
- Keyword stuff category descriptions
- Hide category descriptions from users
- Create too many similar categories (keyword cannibalization)

#### Real-Life Example: Nike

**URL:** `nike.com/w/mens-running-shoes-37v7jzy7ok`

Nike excels at category page optimization:

1. **Clear H1:** "Men's Running Shoes & Sneakers (358)"
2. **Filter Options:** Type, Size, Color, Width, Price
3. **Sorting:** Featured, Newest, Highest Price, Lowest Price
4. **Lifestyle Images:** Inspiring photos of athletes wearing products
5. **Category Description:**
```
"Find men's running shoes designed for speed, comfort, and performance. 
From marathon training to casual jogs, Nike running shoes feature responsive 
cushioning, breathable mesh, and durable traction. Shop the latest styles 
from Nike React, Air Zoom, and Pegasus collections."
```
