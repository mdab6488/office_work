**What Are Buying Guides?**

Buying guides are comprehensive resources that help customers make informed purchasing decisions. They educate users about product features, considerations, and help them choose the right product for their needs.

**Why Buying Guides Matter for SEO:**
- Target high-intent, informational keywords (e.g., "how to choose running shoes")
- Capture users early in the buying journey
- Build trust and authority
- Internal linking opportunities to product pages
- Lower competition than product-focused keywords
