### Comparison Pages

**What Are Comparison Pages?**

Comparison pages directly compare two or more products, helping users decide between specific options. They target high-intent, bottom-of-funnel keywords.

**Why Comparison Pages Are Powerful:**
- Capture users ready to buy
- Target specific product names (high commercial intent)
- Lower competition than brand terms
- Convert at 10-15% (vs 2-3% for general content)
