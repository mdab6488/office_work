### Q1: Is Google Keyword Planner really free?

**A**: Yes! You just need a Google Ads account (also free). However:
- Without active campaigns, you get **search volume ranges** (1K-10K) instead of exact numbers
- With even a small active campaign ($10-20), you get **exact search volumes**

---

### Q2: How accurate is the search volume data?

**A**: Generally quite accurate, but understand:
- It's an **average** over 12 months
- Actual monthly volumes can vary significantly
- Data is **rounded** (not precise to the single digit)
- Doesn't include all Google properties (like YouTube)

**Pro Tip**: Cross-reference with Google Trends for additional validation.

### Q4: Why do I see "Low" or "Medium" competition instead of numbers?

**A**: Google Keyword Planner shows competition for **paid advertising**, not organic SEO difficulty.

- **Low**: Few advertisers bidding on this keyword
- **Medium**: Moderate advertiser competition
- **High**: Many advertisers competing (usually expensive)

**For SEO difficulty**, you need other tools like Moz, Ahrefs, or SEMrush.

---

### Q5: Can I use Keyword Planner without running ads?

**A**: Yes! You can access Keyword Planner in "Expert Mode" without creating campaigns. However:
- You'll see **broader search volume ranges** instead of exact numbers
- Some features may be limited

**To get exact data**: Run a small campaign (even $1/day) to unlock precise numbers.

### Q6: How do I know if a keyword is too competitive?

**Consider these factors together**:

1. **Competition level** (in Keyword Planner): High = harder
2. **Top of page bid**: Over $5 = very competitive
3. **Domain authority**: Check who ranks on page 1 (big brands? news sites?)
4. **Content quality**: Can you create something significantly better?

**Rule of Thumb**: 
- **New site**: Target low competition, long-tail keywords
- **Established site**: Can target medium-high competition
- **Authority site**: Can compete for high competition terms

### Q7: What's a good monthly search volume to target?

**It depends on your goals:**

| Business Type | Ideal Monthly Searches | Why |
|---------------|------------------------|-----|
| Local business | 100-1,000 | Local searches are limited but high-intent |
| Niche e-commerce | 500-5,000 | Specific products, lower volume, higher conversion |
| Content website | 1,000-50,000 | Need volume for ad revenue |
| SaaS company | 1,000-10,000 | Niche market, high customer value |

**Pro Tip**: 10 keywords with 1,000 searches each = 10,000 total potential traffic. Don't put all eggs in one basket!

---

### Q8: How often should search volumes change?

**Typical patterns**:
- **Stable keywords**: 5-10% fluctuation monthly ("how to tie a tie")
- **Seasonal keywords**: 200-500% fluctuation ("Christmas gifts", "tax software")
- **Trending keywords**: Can spike 1000%+ then crash ("viral trends", "news events")
- **Declining keywords**: Gradual decrease over years ("DVD player", "fax machine")

**Action**: Download the monthly breakdown to see patterns.

### Q9: Should I target keywords with zero search volume?

**Generally no, but consider**:

- **New product/topic**: Data might not exist yet
- **Very new keyword**: Might start gaining traction
- **Voice search variations**: Not all captured in data
- **Brand building**: Worth creating content even with low searches

**Example**: "Claude AI tutorial" might show low volume in 2023 but explode in 2024-2025 as product grows.

---

### Q10: Can I use Keyword Planner for YouTube SEO?

**Partially.** Keyword Planner shows Google Search data, not YouTube specifically.

**For YouTube**:
- Use Keyword Planner for general research
- Then use YouTube's search suggestions (autocomplete)
- Check video titles that rank well
- Use dedicated YouTube tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ

**Overlap keywords**: Many searches happen on both Google and YouTube ("how to tie a tie", "recipe for chocolate cake")
