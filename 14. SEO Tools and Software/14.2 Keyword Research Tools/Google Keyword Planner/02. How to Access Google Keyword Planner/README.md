## How to Access

### Prerequisites
- A Google account
- A Google Ads account (free to create)

### Step-by-Step Access

1. **Go to Google Ads**
   - Visit: https://ads.google.com
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create Google Ads Account** (if you don't have one)
   - You don't need to run ads to use Keyword Planner
   - Fill in basic business information
   - You can skip campaign creation

3. **Access Keyword Planner**
   - Click on **Tools & Settings** (wrench icon) in the top right
   - Under "Planning" section, click **Keyword Planner**

### Important Note
If you don't have an active Google Ads campaign, you may see **range-based data** (e.g., "1K-10K" searches) instead of exact numbers. Running even a small campaign ($10-20) can unlock exact search volumes.
