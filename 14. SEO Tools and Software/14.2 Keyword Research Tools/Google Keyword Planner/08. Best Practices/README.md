## Best Practices

### 1. Always Consider Search Intent

**Not all keywords are equal.** Understand what the searcher wants:

| Intent Type | Example | What User Wants | Best Content |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Informational** | "what is SEO" | To learn | Educational blog post, guide |
| **Navigational** | "facebook login" | To find specific page | Brand page, website navigation |
| **Commercial** | "best laptops 2025" | To research before buying | Comparison, reviews |
| **Transactional** | "buy macbook pro" | To purchase now | Product page, checkout |

**Pro Tip**: Match your content type to intent. Don't create a product page for informational keywords!

### 2. Balance Volume and Competition

**Don't just chase high-volume keywords!**

**Example Decision Matrix:**

| Keyword | Searches | Competition | Difficulty | Priority |
|---------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| "insurance" | 1,000,000 | High | Very hard | Low (too competitive) |
| "pet insurance for cats" | 12,100 | Medium | Moderate | High (balanced) |
| "best pet insurance for bengal cats" | 880 | Low | Easy | Medium (easy to rank, but low volume) |

**Sweet Spot**: 1,000-50,000 monthly searches with low-medium competition.

### 3. Location Targeting Matters

**Global vs. Local Results Can Vary Dramatically**

**Example: "Plumber"**

- **United States (national)**: 550,000 monthly searches
- **New York, NY**: 40,500 monthly searches
- **Brooklyn, NY**: 8,100 monthly searches
- **Williamsburg, Brooklyn**: 1,300 monthly searches

**Strategy**:
- Local business? Target specific neighborhoods
- National business? Analyze by major metro areas separately
- Don't waste budget on areas you don't serve

### 4. Use Related Keywords

**Never target just one keyword per page!**

**Example: Targeting "running shoes"**

Also include:
- best running shoes
- running shoes for beginners
- comfortable running shoes
- running shoe reviews
- how to choose running shoes

**Benefit**: 
- More comprehensive content
- Rank for multiple related terms
- Better user experience
- Higher chance of ranking

### 5. Regular Updates

**Search trends change!** Update your keyword research:

- **Every 3 months**: For fast-moving industries (tech, news, trends)
- **Every 6 months**: For stable industries (legal, real estate)
- **Before major campaigns**: Always refresh data before big pushes

**Example**: 
- "NFT" searches: Jan 2022 = 2,500,000 → Jan 2024 = 165,000 (93% drop!)
- Don't base 2025 strategy on 2022 data

### 6. Export and Organize

**Build a Keyword Library**

1. Export keywords to Google Sheets or Excel
2. Add columns for:
   - Target page/article
   - Content status (planned, written, published)
   - Current ranking
   - Priority (high, medium, low)
   - Category/topic cluster
   - Notes

**Template:**

| Keyword | Volume | Competition | Intent | Target Page | Status | Priority | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| best running shoes | 90,500 | High | Commercial | /blog/running-shoes-guide | Published | High | Update quarterly |
| running shoes for flat feet | 12,100 | Medium | Commercial | /blog/flat-feet-shoes | Writing | High | Link from main guide |
