## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Ignoring Competition Level

**Wrong**: "This keyword has 1 million searches! Let's target it!"

**Why It's Wrong**: If competition is "High," you'll never rank organically, and ads will be expensive.

**Right Approach**: Balance volume and competition. Sometimes 5,000 searches with low competition is better than 100,000 with high competition.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Only Looking at One Metric

**Wrong**: Choosing keywords based solely on search volume.

**Why It's Wrong**: You miss:
- Competition levels
- Cost per click (profitability)
- Trend direction (growing or declining?)
- Seasonal patterns

**Right Approach**: Consider all metrics together.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Filtering Irrelevant Keywords

**Example**: You sell "tennis shoes" (for the sport)

**Keyword Results Might Include**:
- tennis shoes (✓ Relevant)
- tennis shoes fashion (? Maybe relevant)
- how to clean tennis shoes (✓ Content opportunity)
- tennis shoes vs sneakers history (✗ Too broad)
- tennis shoe art (✗ Not relevant)

**Right Approach**: Always filter and refine results. Use negative keywords in paid campaigns.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Targeting Keywords That Are Too Broad

**Wrong**: "shoes" (too broad - what kind? for whom? for what activity?)

**Right**: "women's trail running shoes for wide feet" (specific, clear intent)

**Why**: Specific keywords have:
- Higher conversion rates
- Less competition
- Clearer search intent

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not Considering Mobile Search

**Remember**: Over 60% of searches happen on mobile devices.

**Mobile Search Patterns Differ**:
- More voice searches ("near me", questions)
- Shorter attention spans
- More local intent

**Action**: 
- Check mobile vs desktop breakdown in Keyword Planner
- Optimize for featured snippets (answer questions concisely)
- Ensure mobile-friendly landing pages

### ❌ Mistake 6: Forgetting About Branded Keywords

**Don't ignore searches for your own brand!**

**Example**: If you're "BlueSky Yoga Studio"

**Important branded keywords**:
- bluesky yoga
- bluesky yoga schedule
- bluesky yoga prices
- bluesky yoga reviews

**Why It Matters**:
- These are high-intent searches (people already know you)
- Easy to rank for organically
- Cheap to advertise for (if competitors bid on your name)
- High conversion rate

---

### ❌ Mistake 7: Set and Forget

**Wrong**: Doing keyword research once and never updating.

**Why It's Wrong**:
- Trends change
- New competitors emerge
- New keywords become popular
- Seasonal patterns shift

**Right Approach**: Schedule quarterly keyword research reviews.
