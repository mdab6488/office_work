## Limitations

### What AnswerThePublic **IS NOT**:

#### 1. **Not a Full SEO Suite**
- ❌ No backlink analysis
- ❌ No rank tracking

- ❌ No competitor traffic analysis

**Solution:** Use alongside tools like:
- Ahrefs (backlinks, competitor analysis)

- Google Search Console (performance tracking)
- Screaming Frog (technical audits)

#### 2. **Limited Search Volume Accuracy**
- Data is estimated (not exact)
- Multiple data providers used

**Solution:** Cross-reference with Google Keyword Planner for exact volumes.

#### 3. **No Contextual Time Frames**
- Doesn't show when questions peak
- No historical trend graphs (unless Pro)
- Can't see seasonal patterns easily

**Solution:** Use Google Trends to check seasonality.

#### 4. **Repetitive Results**
- Similar questions may appear multiple times
- Slight variations of same query
- Can be overwhelming

**Solution:** Use filtering to remove duplicates, export to Excel for deduplication.

#### 5. **Free Plan Restrictions**
- Only 3 searches per day
- Limited export options
- Can't save searches
- No project organization
- No alerts

**Solution:** Plan searches strategically or upgrade to paid plan.

#### 6. **No Direct Actionable Advice**

**Solution:** Combine with SEO expertise or take AnswerThePublic's training courses.

### What It **DOESN'T** Do:
