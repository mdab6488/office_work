## Best Practices

### 1. Start Broad, Then Go Niche

**Don't:**
- Start with: "best red leather running shoes for women with flat feet"

**Do:**
- Start with: "running shoes"
- Then refine: "running shoes for women"
- Then niche: "running shoes for flat feet"

### 2. Focus on Long-Tail Keywords

**Why long-tail keywords are better:**
- **Less competition** - Easier to rank
- **Higher intent** - More specific user needs
- **Better conversion** - Users know what they want
- **More targeted traffic** - Attract the right audience

**Example:**
- Short-tail: "laptop" (High competition, vague intent)
- Long-tail: "best laptop for video editing under $1000" (Low competition, clear intent)

### 3. Use Question Keywords for Content

**Question keywords = Content goldmine**

**Types of questions:**
- **How to:** Tutorial content
- **What is:** Definition/explanation content
- **Why does:** In-depth analysis
- **Where can:** Location-based content
- **When should:** Timing/planning content

**Example content mapping:**
- "how to train a puppy" → Blog tutorial with step-by-step guide
- "what is puppy training" → Comprehensive guide for beginners
- "why does puppy training fail" → Problem-solving article
- "when should puppy training start" → Timeline guide

### 4. Analyze Search Intent

**4 types of search intent:**

**1. Informational** - User wants to learn
- Keywords: "what is", "how to", "guide", "tips"
- Content type: Blog posts, tutorials, guides

**2. Navigational** - User wants a specific website
- Keywords: Brand names, "login", "website"
- Content type: Homepage, branded pages

**3. Transactional** - User wants to buy
- Keywords: "buy", "order", "price", "coupon"
- Content type: Product pages, checkout pages

**4. Commercial Investigation** - User comparing options
- Keywords: "best", "review", "vs", "comparison"
- Content type: Comparison articles, reviews

**Match your content to intent!**

### 5. Use the Keyword Basket Feature

**Benefits:**
- Compare keywords from multiple searches
- Organize by category
- Bulk export
- Prioritize based on multiple factors

**Example workflow:**
1. Search "coffee machine" → Add top 20 keywords to basket
2. Search "espresso machine" → Add top 20 keywords to basket
3. Search "coffee maker" → Add top 20 keywords to basket
4. Export all 60 keywords
5. Remove duplicates
6. Prioritize by search volume and relevance

### 6. Localize Your Research

**Different countries = different search behavior**

**Example: "Football"**

**United States:**
- football tickets NFL
- football games today
- fantasy football

**United Kingdom:**
- football fixtures premier league
- football results
- football transfers

**Tip:** Always select the correct Google domain and language for your target market.

### 7. Combine with Google Keyword Planner

**Workflow:**
1. Generate keywords with KeywordTool.io (get ideas)
2. Export keywords to CSV
3. Import into Google Keyword Planner (get precise data)
4. Filter by search volume, competition, and CPC
5. Create final keyword list

**Why this works:**
- KeywordTool.io finds keywords Google Keyword Planner misses
- Google Keyword Planner provides more accurate data
- Best of both worlds

### 8. Track Seasonal Trends

**Use trend data to:**
- Identify peak seasons
- Plan content in advance
- Capitalize on temporary spikes
- Avoid declining keywords

**Example:**
- "halloween costumes" - Spikes in September-October
- "tax software" - Spikes in January-April
- "beach vacation" - Spikes in summer

Create content 2-3 months before peak season.

### 9. Export and Organize

**Create a master keyword spreadsheet:**

**Columns to include:**
- Keyword
- Search Volume
- Trend
- CPC
- Competition
- Search Intent
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Target Page/Content
- Current Ranking
- Status (To Create/Published/Ranking)

**Update regularly:**
- Monthly: Add new keywords
- Quarterly: Review performance
- Annually: Major strategy refresh

### 10. Don't Ignore Low-Volume Keywords

**Why low-volume keywords matter:**
- Less competition
- Often highly specific (better conversion)
- Combined, they add up to significant traffic
- Easier to rank for

**Example:**
- 1 keyword with 10,000 searches (ultra-competitive)
- vs
- 100 keywords with 100 searches each (10,000 total, much easier)

**The long-tail strategy often wins!**
