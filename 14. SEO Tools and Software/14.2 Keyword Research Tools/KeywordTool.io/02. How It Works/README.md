## How It Works

### The Technology Behind It

KeywordTool.io uses **Google Autocomplete** as its primary data source. Here's the process:

1. **You enter a seed keyword** (e.g., "running shoes")
2. **The tool prepends and appends** different letters, numbers, and characters
3. **Queries Google's autocomplete** with variations like:
   - "running shoes a", "running shoes b", "running shoes c"
   - "a running shoes", "b running shoes", "c running shoes"
   - "running shoes for", "running shoes with", etc.
4. **Collects all suggestions** Google provides
5. **Presents them** in an organized, easy-to-understand format

### Why Google Autocomplete?

Google Autocomplete suggestions are based on:
- **Real search frequency** - How often people actually search for terms
- **Search trends** - Recent popularity of search queries
- **User location** - Regional search patterns
- **Language preferences** - Local search behavior

This means the keywords you get are based on **actual user behavior**, not guesswork.
