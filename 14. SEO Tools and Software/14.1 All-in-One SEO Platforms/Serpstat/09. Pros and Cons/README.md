- 1 user (no collaboration)
- Limited historical data
- No white-label reports
```

- Copy-pasted from docs occasionally
- Complex issues take longer
- Better support on higher plans
- Language barriers possible

#### **6. Site Audit Takes Time**
```
Audit Speed for Large Sites:
1,000 pages: ~15-20 minutes
10,000 pages: ~2-3 hours
50,000 pages: ~6-12 hours

Depends on plan and scanning speed selected
```

#### **7. Some Features Less Developed**
- On-page SEO tool lacks depth
- Text analytics could be more advanced

Real-time data requires more expensive plans
