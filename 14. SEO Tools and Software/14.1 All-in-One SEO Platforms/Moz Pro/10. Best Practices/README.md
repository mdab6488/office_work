## Best Practices

### 1. Set Up Campaigns Properly

**DO:**
```
✅ Use exact domain format: www.example.com OR example.com (be consistent)
✅ Add real competitors (sites ranking for your target keywords)
✅ Choose correct country/language
✅ Set up Google Analytics integration for complete data
✅ Name campaigns clearly: "Client Name - Main Site"
```

**DON'T:**
```
❌ Add http:// or https:// (Moz adds automatically)
❌ Add competitors you don't actually compete with in search
❌ Mix multiple domains in one campaign
❌ Use vague campaign names like "Website 1"
```

### 2. Prioritize Site Crawl Issues

**Priority Order:**
```
1. CRITICAL (Fix immediately):
   - Broken pages (404 errors)
   - Redirect chains
   - Duplicate title tags
   - Pages blocked by robots.txt
   - Severe site speed issues (>5 seconds)

2. HIGH (Fix within 1-2 weeks):
   - Missing meta descriptions
   - Thin content
   - Missing alt tags
   - 4xx errors
   - Too-long titles (>60 characters)

3. MEDIUM (Fix within 1 month):
   - Long URLs
   - Pages with low word count
   - H1 tag issues

4. LOW (Monitor, fix when possible):
   - Minor HTML issues
   - Non-critical warnings
```

### 3. Keyword Research Workflow

**Step-by-Step Process:**
```
1. Brainstorm 10-20 seed keywords
2. Enter each into Keyword Explorer
3. Review "Keyword Suggestions" for each
4. Export all suggestions to CSV
5. Filter by:
   - Volume: >500 searches/month
   - Difficulty: <60 (adjust based on your DA)
   - Organic CTR: >30%
6. Categorize by search intent:
   - Informational: "how to", "what is", "guide"
   - Transactional: "buy", "best", "reviews", "coupon"
   - Navigational: Brand names
7. Prioritize based on:
   - Business value (will it drive sales/leads?)
   - Achievability (can you realistically rank?)
   - Volume (is there enough search demand?)
8. Create content calendar around prioritized keywords
```

**Pro Tip:** Target keywords where your DA is within 20 points of top-ranking pages. If they have DA 60+ and you have DA 20, it's too competitive.

### 4. Link Building Strategy

**Sustainable Link Building:**
```
Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Fix all broken links on your site
- Claim unlinked brand mentions (Fresh Web Explorer)
- Get listed in relevant directories (DMOZ, industry-specific)
- Recover lost backlinks (contact sites that removed your links)

Phase 2: Content-Driven (Months 4-9)
- Create linkable assets (research studies, tools, infographics)
- Use Link Intersect to find opportunities
- Guest post on relevant blogs (DA 30+)
- Build relationships with industry influencers

Phase 3: Scale (Months 10+)
- Replicate what worked in Phase 2
- Create more linkable content
- Broken link building (find broken links, offer your content)
- HARO (Help A Reporter Out) for media mentions
```

**Avoid:**
```
❌ Buying links (Google penalty risk)
❌ Link farms and PBNs (Private Blog Networks)
❌ Spammy directory submissions
❌ Excessive reciprocal links
❌ Links from unrelated websites
```

### 5. Rank Tracking Best Practices

**Set Up Correctly:**
```
✅ Add keywords you realistically want to rank for
✅ Include branded keywords (your company name)
✅ Track competitors for same keywords
✅ Set up labels: "High Priority", "Money Keywords", "Informational"
✅ Enable SERP features tracking (featured snippets, etc.)
✅ Track mobile and desktop separately for local business
```

**Monitoring Schedule:**
```
Daily: Check high-priority money keywords manually
Weekly: Review automated reports for all keywords
Monthly: Analyze trends, adjust strategy
Quarterly: Audit keyword list, remove irrelevant, add new
```
