## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake #1: Tracking Too Many Keywords

**Problem:**
"I'm tracking 400 keywords but only have budget for 300."

**Solution:**
- Focus on keywords that actually matter to your business
- Track 20-50 core "money keywords" closely
- Track branded keywords separately
- Remove vanity keywords that don't drive business value

### ❌ Mistake #2: Ignoring Technical SEO

**Problem:**
"I'm creating great content but traffic isn't growing."

**Solution:**
- Run Site Crawl WEEKLY
- Fix critical issues immediately
- Don't ignore duplicate content warnings
- Pay attention to site speed issues
- Technical SEO is the foundation—content won't help if Google can't crawl your site

### ❌ Mistake #3: Not Monitoring Competitors

**Problem:**
"My competitor suddenly outranks me and I don't know why."

**Solution:**
- Set up competitor campaigns
- Monitor their backlink growth weekly
- Use Link Intersect quarterly
- Analyze their new content monthly
- Set up Fresh Web Explorer alerts for competitor mentions

### ❌ Mistake #4: Chasing High-Difficulty Keywords

**Problem:**
"I'm targeting 'insurance' (difficulty 98) with my DA 15 site."

**Solution:**
```
Instead of: "insurance" (98 difficulty, impossible to rank)
Target: "small business insurance for photographers" (42 difficulty)
        "photography equipment insurance cost" (38 difficulty)
        "best insurance for wedding photographers" (35 difficulty)
```
- Target keywords where difficulty is within 30 points of your DA
- Build authority with easier keywords first
- Progress to harder keywords as DA grows

### ❌ Mistake #5: Not Using the On-Page Grader

**Problem:**
"My content isn't ranking and I don't know why."

**Solution:**
- Run EVERY page through On-Page Grader before publishing
- Aim for 80+ score minimum
- Fix all critical issues (title, meta, headers)
- Don't keyword stuff—use keywords naturally
- Remember: Content quality + optimization = rankings

---

### ❌ Mistake #6: Focusing Only on Domain Authority

**Problem:**
"My DA went from 35 to 36! But traffic didn't increase."

**Solution:**
- DA is a comparative metric, not a Google ranking factor
- Focus on: rankings, traffic, conversions
- Use DA to compare against competitors, not as absolute measure
- Increasing DA is a byproduct of good SEO, not the goal itself

### ❌ Mistake #7: Not Fixing Crawl Errors

**Problem:**
"Site Crawl shows 500 issues but I ignore them."

**Solution:**
```
Month 1: Fix ALL critical issues (usually 10-30)
Month 2: Fix ALL high-priority issues (usually 50-100)
Month 3: Fix medium-priority issues gradually

Result: Site health improves → Google crawls better → Rankings improve
```
