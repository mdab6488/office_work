### The Origins
- **2004**: Founded as "Majestic-12" by Alex Chudnovsky in the United Kingdom as an open-source distributed search engine project
- **2008**: Launched commercially as "Majestic SEO" - a backlink analysis tool based on its growing web index
- **2009-2014**: Introduced proprietary metrics like Trust Flow and Citation Flow; expanded infrastructure
- **2014**: Rebranded to simply "Majestic" to reflect broader focus on web-scale link intelligence
- **Present**: Operates independently from Birmingham, UK; ranked 18th in Deloitte Fast 50 UK tech companies (2014)
