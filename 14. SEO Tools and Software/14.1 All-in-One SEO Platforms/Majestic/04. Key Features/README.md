## Key Features

### 1. **Trust Flow (TF)** ⭐

**What It Is**: A score from 0-100 measuring the **quality** and **trustworthiness** of backlinks.

**How It's Calculated**: 
- Based on the quality and authority of linking domains
- Sites linked from trusted sources (gov, edu, established news sites) score higher
- Uses a logarithmic scale - getting from 40 to 50 is harder than 10 to 20

**Real-Life Example**:
```
Your Blog Post: Trust Flow = 15
- 5 links from random blogs (TF 5-10 each)
- 1 link from New York Times (TF 85)
- Result: Your TF increases significantly!

Your Blog Post: Trust Flow = 8
- 100 links from spam directories (TF 0-2 each)
- Result: Low TF despite high link count
```

**Practical Use**:
- **TF 0-15**: New site or low-quality backlink profile
- **TF 15-30**: Decent site with some quality backlinks
- **TF 30-50**: Established site with good authority
- **TF 50-70**: High authority site (major brands, publications)
- **TF 70+**: Top-tier sites (Wikipedia, major news outlets, government sites)

### 2. **Citation Flow (CF)** 📊

**What It Is**: A score from 0-100 measuring the **quantity** and **power** of backlinks (regardless of quality).

**How It's Calculated**:
- Based on the number of links pointing to your site
- Considers the citation flow of the linking pages
- Does NOT consider trustworthiness

**Real-Life Example**:
```
Scenario A - Balanced Profile:
- Trust Flow: 35
- Citation Flow: 40
- Interpretation: Healthy backlink profile with good quality

Scenario B - Spam Warning:
- Trust Flow: 5
- Citation Flow: 65
- Interpretation: Lots of links but mostly low-quality (potential spam)

Scenario C - Opportunity:
- Trust Flow: 45
- Citation Flow: 25
- Interpretation: High-quality links but room to build more
```

### 3. **Topical Trust Flow** 🎯

**What It Is**: Shows the TOPIC/CATEGORY of websites linking to you.

**Why It Matters**: Relevance! A link from a fitness blog to your fitness website is worth more than a link from a random tech blog.

**Real-Life Example**:
```
Your Fitness Website receives links from:
- 60% Health/Fitness sites → Topical Trust Flow = Health (45)
- 25% Business sites → Topical Trust Flow = Business (28)
- 15% Regional sites → Topical Trust Flow = Regional (20)

This tells you:
✓ Your link profile is highly relevant to your niche
✓ Most backlinks come from appropriate sources
✓ Good topical authority in Health/Fitness
```

**Categories Include**:
- Computers/Internet/Web Design and Development
- Health/Fitness
- Business/Finance
- Regional/Local
- Reference/Education
- And 500+ more topics
