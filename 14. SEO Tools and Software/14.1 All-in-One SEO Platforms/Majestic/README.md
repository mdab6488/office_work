## Common Questions

**Q: How often does Majestic update?**
A: Fresh Index updates continuously (daily/weekly for most sites). Historic Index is cumulative and always available.

**Q: Is Trust Flow the same as Domain Authority?**
A: No. TF (Majestic) measures link quality. DA (Moz) is similar but different algorithm. Both are valid metrics.

**Q: Can I get a refund if I don't like it?**
A: Majestic offers trial periods. Check their refund policy as it varies by plan.

**Q: Does Majestic help with on-page SEO?**
A: No. Majestic is ONLY for backlinks. Use Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, or SEMrush for on-page.

**Q: How do I export more than 1 million backlinks?**
A: Use Advanced Reports or API. Contact Majestic for custom exports.

**Q: What's the difference between Majestic and Google Search Console?**
A: GSC shows links Google found. Majestic shows all links (including ones Google might not count). Use both!
