## Best Practices

### 1. **Interpreting Trust Flow vs Citation Flow**

```
The "TF/CF Ratio Rule":

HEALTHY PROFILE:
TF: 35, CF: 38 → Ratio: 0.92 ✓
- Quality and quantity in balance
- Natural link growth
- No major issues

SPAM WARNING:
TF: 12, CF: 65 → Ratio: 0.18 🚩
- Lots of links (CF high)
- Poor quality (TF low)
- Likely spam or paid links
- Action: Audit immediately!

OPPORTUNITY:
TF: 45, CF: 30 → Ratio: 1.50 💡
- High-quality links (TF)
- Room for more links (CF)
- Keep building, but maintain quality

GUIDELINE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Ratio 0.8-1.2: Healthy ✓
Ratio < 0.5: Spam risk 🚩
Ratio > 1.5: Growth opportunity 💡
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### 2. **When to Use Fresh vs Historic Index**

```
USE FRESH INDEX WHEN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Monitoring active campaigns
✓ Tracking recent link building efforts
✓ Checking if new backlinks went live
✓ Competitive intelligence (what they're doing NOW)
✓ Quick daily/weekly checks

Example: "Did that guest post link go live yet?"
→ Fresh Index → Check New Links (last 7 days)

USE HISTORIC INDEX WHEN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Evaluating domains for purchase
✓ Long-term trend analysis
✓ Investigating traffic drops from past
✓ Finding old, valuable links
✓ Comprehensive audits

Example: "Why did this site lose authority in 2020?"
→ Historic Index → Backlink History → Check 2020 data
```

### 3. **Red Flags to Watch For**

```
🚩 RED FLAG #1: Unnatural TF/CF Ratio
TF: 8, CF: 75
→ Too many low-quality links
→ Action: Link audit required

🚩 RED FLAG #2: Sudden TF Drop
Jan: TF 45 → Feb: TF 32 (-13 points)
→ Major backlinks lost or devalued
→ Action: Check Lost Links report immediately

🚩 RED FLAG #3: Spiky Backlink Growth
Normal: +5-10 links per month
Suspicious: +500 links in one day
→ Potential negative SEO attack or spam
→ Action: Investigate, possibly disavow

🚩 RED FLAG #4: Irrelevant Topical Trust Flow
Your Site: Fitness Blog
Top Topic: Casino/Gambling (35%)
→ Links from wrong industry
→ Action: Remove or disavow irrelevant links

🚩 RED FLAG #5: Too Many Exact Match Anchors
50% of anchors: "buy cheap shoes"
→ Unnatural optimization
→ Google penalty risk
→ Action: Diversify anchor text

🚩 RED FLAG #6: PBN Detection
20 new links from different domains
All on same IP address
All registered same day
→ Private Blog Network
→ Action: Disavow immediately
```

### 5. **Link Building Velocity**

```
What is Safe Link Building Velocity?

NEW SITE (0-6 months old):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Safe: 5-15 new referring domains/month
Risky: 50+ new domains/month
→ Build slowly, focus on quality

ESTABLISHED SITE (1-3 years):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Safe: 15-40 new domains/month
Risky: 100+ new domains/month
→ Steady, consistent growth

AUTHORITY SITE (3+ years, TF 40+):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Safe: 40-100+ new domains/month
Less Risk: Natural mentions scale with authority

HOW TO TRACK IN MAJESTIC:
1. Campaigns → Set up your site
2. Check "New Backlinks" monthly
3. Count unique referring domains
4. Plot on graph to see trends

EXAMPLE GRAPH:
Domains/Month
100 |                    
 75 |              ╱╲    ⚠ Too fast!
 50 |          ╱╲╱  ╲╱╲  
 25 |      ╱╲╱           
  0 |____╱________________
    Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun

Ideal: Steady upward slope, not spiky
