## What is Majestic?

**Majestic** (formerly Majestic SEO) is a specialized web-based SEO tool that focuses exclusively on **backlink analysis**. Unlike all-in-one SEO platforms like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz, Majestic dedicates 100% of its resources to building and maintaining the world's largest link intelligence database.

### Key Characteristics:
- **World's Largest Link Database**: Majestic crawls the web independently, maintaining its own massive index
- **Backlink-Only Focus**: Does NOT offer keyword research, on-page SEO, or content analysis
- **Independent Crawler**: Unlike many tools that rely on third-party data, Majestic crawls the web directly
- **Historical Data**: Extensive historical backlink records dating back years
- **Proprietary Metrics**: Trust Flow and Citation Flow - industry-standard link quality metrics

### Who Uses Majestic?
- **SEO Agencies**: For client link audits and competitive analysis
- **Digital Marketers**: For link building strategies and PR campaigns
- **Domain Traders**: To evaluate domain authority before purchasing
- **Content Marketers**: To identify link-worthy content opportunities
- **Webmasters**: To monitor and protect their backlink profiles
