## Core Concepts

### Understanding Link Analysis

Before diving into Majestic, it's crucial to understand why backlinks matter:

1. **Search Engine Rankings**: Google and other search engines use backlinks as "votes of confidence"
2. **Domain Authority**: Quality backlinks from trusted sites increase your site's authority
3. **Referral Traffic**: Good backlinks bring actual visitors to your site
4. **Brand Visibility**: Links from relevant sites increase your brand exposure

### The Two Indexes

Majestic maintains TWO distinct indexes:

#### 1. **Fresh Index**
- Updated continuously (daily/weekly)
- Shows recent backlinks (last 90-120 days)
- Best for: Monitoring new link acquisitions, tracking campaigns
- **Use Case**: You just launched a PR campaign and want to see new mentions

#### 2. **Historic Index**
- Contains data going back many years
- Shows complete backlink history
- Best for: Long-term analysis, domain evaluation, historical trends
- **Use Case**: Evaluating a domain for purchase - you want to see if it has toxic backlink history
