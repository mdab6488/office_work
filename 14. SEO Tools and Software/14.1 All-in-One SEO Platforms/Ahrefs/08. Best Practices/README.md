## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Monitoring Schedule

**Daily**:
- Check Rank Tracker for important keywords
- Monitor new backlinks (for negative SEO detection)

**Weekly**:
- Review organic traffic trends
- Check for new ranking keywords
- Monitor competitors' new content

**Monthly**:
- Full site audit
- Comprehensive backlink analysis
- Keyword portfolio review
- Content performance analysis
- Competitor strategy assessment

### 2. Data-Driven Decision Making

**Example Workflow**:
```
Question: "Should we write about Topic A or Topic B?"

Ahrefs Analysis:

Topic A: "keto diet for beginners"
- KD: 65 (hard)
- Volume: 22,000
- Top page has DR 75, 89 backlinks
- Realistic timeline: 8-12 months

Topic B: "keto meal prep for busy moms"
- KD: 25 (easy)
- Volume: 1,900
- Top page has DR 35, 12 backlinks
- Realistic timeline: 2-3 months

Decision: Start with Topic B
- Quicker wins build authority
- Can use success to eventually tackle Topic A
- More specific = better conversion rate
```

### 3. Competitive Intelligence

**Monthly Competitor Review**:
```
Track 3-5 main competitors:

Competitor A (example: bigcompetitor.com)
- New pages published: 12 this month
- New backlinks: 89
- Lost backlinks: 12
- Biggest ranking gain: "how to [topic]" (#15 → #3)

Action Items:
1. Analyze their "how to [topic]" article
2. Create better version
3. Target similar backlink sources
4. Monitor for more patterns
```

### 4. Link Building Strategy

**Using Ahrefs for Link Building**:

**Method 1: Broken Link Building**
```
1. Find competitor's broken backlinks
   Site Explorer → Backlinks → Filter: "404 not found"

2. Example:
   Broken Page: competitor.com/old-seo-guide (404)
   Backlinks to it: 23 websites
   
3. Create similar content on your site
4. Contact those 23 websites:
   "The page you linked to is broken. 
    Here's an updated resource..."
```

**Method 2: Replicating Competitors' Links**
```
1. Site Explorer → Enter competitor domain
2. Backlinks → Best by links
3. Find patterns:
   - Guest posts on industry blogs
   - Resource page listings
   - Interviews and podcasts
   - Tool directories
   
4. Pursue same opportunities
```

**Method 3: Content-Based Link Building**
```
1. Content Explorer → Search industry topic
2. Filter: Referring domains 50+
3. Study top linkable assets:
   - Statistics roundups
   - Original research
   - Industry reports
   - Free tools
   - Templates
   
4. Create better version
5. Outreach to sites linking to original
```

### 5. Content Optimization Workflow

**Step-by-Step Process**:

**For Existing Content (Not Ranking Well)**:

1. **Analyze Current Position**
   ```
   Keyword: "email marketing tips"
   Current Position: 15
   Target: Top 5
   ```

2. **Study Top 5 Results**
   ```
   Use Keywords Explorer → SERP analysis
   
   Position 1: 2,800 words, DR 65, 23 backlinks
   Position 2: 3,200 words, DR 58, 31 backlinks
   Position 3: 2,400 words, DR 71, 18 backlinks
   
   Average:
   - 2,800 words
   - 24 backlinks
   - DR 65
   ```

3. **Content Gap**
   ```
   What top results cover that you don't:
   - Email automation workflows
   - A/B testing strategies
   - Mobile optimization tips
   - GDPR compliance
   - Interactive examples
   ```

4. **Optimize Your Content**
   ```
   Expand to 3,000+ words
   Add missing sections
   Update statistics
   Add visual examples
   Include expert quotes
   Create downloadable resources
   ```

5. **Build Links**
   ```
   Need ~20-25 backlinks to compete
   Target: Industry blogs, resource pages, partners
   Timeline: 3-4 months
   ```
