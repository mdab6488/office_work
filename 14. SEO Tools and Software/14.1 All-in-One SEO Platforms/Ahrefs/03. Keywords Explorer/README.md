## Keywords Explorer

### What It Does
Helps you discover and analyze keywords for your SEO strategy.

### Key Metrics Explained

#### 1. **Keyword Difficulty (KD)**
- **Scale**: 0-100
- **Measures**: How hard it is to rank in the top 10

**Real-Life Examples**:
```
Keyword: "insurance" 
KD: 95 (Extremely Hard - dominated by huge brands)

Keyword: "best running shoes for flat feet"
KD: 45 (Medium - achievable with quality content)

Keyword: "vegan protein powder for women over 50"
KD: 12 (Easy - great opportunity!)
```

#### 2. **Search Volume**
Shows average monthly searches

**Example Analysis**:
```
Keyword: "coffee maker"
Search Volume: 201,000/month
But...
Keyword: "best drip coffee maker under $100"
Search Volume: 3,600/month
KD: 25 (Much easier to rank!)
```

**Lesson**: Lower volume with lower difficulty often = better opportunity

#### 3. **Traffic Potential**
Shows how much traffic the #1 ranking page actually gets

**Real Example**:
```
Keyword: "how to tie a tie"
Search Volume: 90,000/month
Traffic Potential: 450,000/month

Why? Because the top page also ranks for:
- "how to tie a windsor knot"
- "how to tie a necktie"
- "easy tie knot"
- 200+ other related keywords
```
