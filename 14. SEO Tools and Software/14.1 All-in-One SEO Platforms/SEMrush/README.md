## Common SEMrush Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Targeting High-Difficulty Keywords Too Early
```
❌ Wrong Approach:
- New site targeting "best credit card" (Difficulty: 89%)
- No existing authority
- Competing against Investopedia, NerdWallet, etc.

✅ Correct Approach:
- Start with "best credit card for college students with no credit" (Difficulty: 32%)
- Build authority with easier wins
- Gradually move to competitive terms
```

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Search Intent
```
❌ Wrong Approach:
Keyword: "running shoes" (commercial intent)
Your Content: History of running shoe technology (informational)
Result: Won't rank, wrong intent

✅ Correct Approach:
Keyword: "running shoes" → Create comparison/review page
Keyword: "history of running shoes" → Create informational article
Match content to intent
```

### Mistake 3: Only Looking at Search Volume
```
❌ Wrong Approach:
"weight loss" - 368,000 searches (too competitive, vague)

✅ Correct Approach:
"weight loss meal plan for vegetarians" - 5,400 searches
- Lower volume but higher intent
- Easier to rank
- Better conversion rate
```

### Mistake 4: Not Acting on Site Audit Findings
```
❌ Wrong Approach:
- Run audit monthly
- See same 45 errors
- Never fix anything
- Wonder why rankings don't improve

✅ Correct Approach:
- Run audit
- Fix critical errors within 48 hours
- Schedule time weekly for remaining issues
- Re-audit to verify fixes
```

### Mistake 5: Copying Competitors Exactly
```
❌ Wrong Approach:
Competitor ranks for "digital marketing guide"
You write identical "digital marketing guide"
Result: No differentiation, harder to rank

✅ Correct Approach:
Add unique value:
- "Digital Marketing Guide with Real Campaign Results"
- Include case studies competitors don't have
- Add video tutorials
- Create downloadable templates
- Provide something competitors can't
```
