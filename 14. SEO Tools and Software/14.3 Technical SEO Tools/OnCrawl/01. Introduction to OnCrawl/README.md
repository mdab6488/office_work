## Introduction to OnCrawl

### What is OnCrawl?

OnCrawl is an enterprise-level technical SEO platform that combines **website crawling** and **log file analysis** to provide comprehensive insights into how search engines interact with your website. Unlike traditional crawlers that only show you what they find, OnCrawl uniquely correlates what a crawler *can* find with what Google *actually* crawls through server log analysis.

### Key Differentiators

**What Makes OnCrawl Unique:**
- **Dual Analysis**: Combines crawl data with log file analysis in one platform
- **JavaScript Rendering**: Can crawl both static HTML and JavaScript-rendered content
- **Data Studio Integration**: Native Google Data Studio connector for custom reporting
- **API-First Architecture**: Full API access for automation and integration
- **Big Data Handling**: Designed to handle enterprise websites with millions of pages
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track crawl budget and indexation in real-time

### Who Should Use OnCrawl?

**Ideal For:**
- Enterprise SEO teams managing large-scale websites (100,000+ pages)
- Technical SEO specialists focusing on crawl optimization
- E-commerce sites with dynamic inventory
- Media sites with extensive content archives
- Agencies managing multiple large clients
- Sites experiencing crawl budget issues

**Not Ideal For:**
- Small websites under 1,000 pages (overkill)
- Users only needing basic keyword research
- Those without technical SEO knowledge
- Businesses without access to server log files
