## Introduction

JetOctopus is a cloud-based SEO crawler and log analyzer designed for technical SEO professionals, digital agencies, and website owners managing large-scale websites. Unlike traditional desktop crawlers, JetOctopus operates entirely in the cloud, offering unprecedented speed (up to 250 pages per second) without consuming your computer's resources.

### Why JetOctopus Stands Out

- **Ultra-Fast Crawling**: 250 pages/second (50K pages in ~5 minutes)
- **Cloud-Based**: No installation, no memory consumption on your PC
- **Comprehensive Data Integration**: Combines Crawl + Log Files + Google Search Console + Google Analytics
- **No Limits**: Unlimited projects, simultaneous crawls, and users
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Live log processing and instant insights
- **JavaScript Rendering**: Full headless Chrome crawling for modern websites
- **Affordable Pricing**: Pay-as-you-go model suitable for freelancers to enterprise
