## Introduction

DeepCrawl, rebranded as **Lumar** in 2021, is an enterprise-level technical SEO platform that specializes in website crawling, auditing, and monitoring. It's designed for large-scale websites and helps identify technical SEO issues that could impact search engine rankings and user experience.

### Why DeepCrawl/Lumar Matters

Technical SEO issues can:
- Prevent search engines from crawling and indexing your content
- Cause ranking drops and traffic losses
- Create poor user experiences
- Waste crawl budget on unimportant pages
- Lead to duplicate content issues

DeepCrawl helps you identify and fix these issues before they impact your organic performance.
