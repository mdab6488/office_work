### 2.1 Multi-Platform Distribution

#### Strategic Platform Selection

```
Real Example: Gary Vaynerchuk's "Content Pyramid" Strategy

Original Long-Form Video (YouTube):
    ↓
Reformat for Each Platform:
├── LinkedIn: 3-min professional insights clip
├── Instagram: 60-sec visual highlights + Story sequence
├── Twitter: 2-min thread with embedded clips
├── TikTok: 15-30 sec hook-focused version
├── Facebook: Native upload with captions
└── Blog: Embedded video + transcription

Result: 10x reach from single video asset
```

**Platform-Specific Optimization:**

| Platform | Length | Format | SEO Elements |
|----------|--------|--------|--------------|
| YouTube | 8-15 min | Horizontal (16:9) | Title, Description, Tags, Chapters |
| LinkedIn | 2-5 min | Horizontal/Square | Professional hooks, Text overlays |
| Instagram | 60-90 sec | Vertical (9:16) | Hashtags, Location tags |
| TikTok | 15-60 sec | Vertical | Trending sounds, Hashtags |
| Twitter | 45-140 sec | Square (1:1) | Thread integration, Alt text |
| Facebook | 1-3 min | Square/Horizontal | Native upload (not YouTube link) |

### 2.3 Community & Forum Marketing

#### Strategic Forum Participation

```
Real Example: Patrick McKenzie (patio11) Video Marketing

Platforms Used:

- Reddit r/entrepreneur: Shared video case studies
- Indie Hackers: Video interviews with founders

Rules Followed:
✓ 90/10 rule: 9 helpful comments for every 1 self-promotion
✓ Always add context: "I made a video about this: [link]"
✓ Native platform discussion first, video as supplement
✗ Never spam or pure self-promotion

Result: Consistent front-page rankings, 10,000+ views per video
```

**Platform-Specific Strategies:**

**Reddit:**
```
1. Find relevant subreddits (r/marketing, r/SEO, r/videography)
2. Build karma with helpful comments (2-3 weeks)
3. Share video as solution to common problems
4. Respond to all comments
5. Use format: "I created a video explaining this: [title]"
```

**Quora:**
```
1. Answer 10-15 questions in your niche
2. Include video when it adds genuine value
3. Format: Write 200-300 word answer + "I go deeper in this video:"
4. Track which question topics drive most video views
5. Double down on high-performing question types
```

### 2.4 Influencer Collaboration

#### Co-Creation Strategy

```
Real Example: Shopify's YouTube Partner Program
- Collaborated with 50+ e-commerce YouTubers
- Created co-branded tutorial videos
- Cross-promoted to combined audiences

Structure:
1. Identify complementary channels (similar audience, not competitors)
2. Propose co-created content (interviews, tutorials, case studies)
3. Both channels publish versions with mutual links
4. Coordinate launch timing for maximum impact

Results:
- Average 40% audience crossover per collaboration
- 2-3x normal view counts
- Quality backlinks from partner channels
```

**Collaboration Pitch Template:**
```
