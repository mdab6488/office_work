#### End Screens (Last 5-20 Seconds)

```

**Design Tips:**

```

#### Cards (During Video)

Cards appear as small, clickable teasers during your video.

**Card Types:**

1. **Video or Playlist Cards**
   ```
   Use when: Mentioning related content
   Example: "I covered that in my video about X"
   Timing: Right when you mention it
   ```

2. **Channel Cards**
   ```
   Use when: Collaborations or recommendations
   Example: "My friend John's channel is amazing"
   ```

3. **Poll Cards**
   ```
   Use when: Gathering feedback
   Example: "What content do you want next?"
   Timing: Mid-video for engagement
   ```

4. **Link Cards** (for partners)
   ```
   Use when: Promoting external resources
   Example: "Get the free checklist"
   ```

#### Card Strategy

**Real-Life Example: Marques Brownlee (MKBHD)**

```
Video: "iPhone 15 Pro Review"

Card 1 (2:30): Links to "iPhone 14 Pro Comparison"
Card 2 (5:45): Links to "Best iPhone 15 Cases" video
Card 3 (8:00): Poll - "Are you upgrading?"
```

**Card Best Practices:**

```
✅ Use 2-5 cards per video (don't overdo it)
✅ Place when you verbally mention related content
✅ Add teaser text ("Check out that video here")
✅ Use first card within first 15-20% of video
✅ Space cards at least 30 seconds apart
✅ Track card click-through rates
✅ Link to videos with good retention
```

#### Combined Strategy

**The Power Combo:**

1. **Mid-Video Card**
   - "BTW, I made a detailed video on this topic..."
   - Card appears linking to related video

2. **End Screen**
   - Links to next logical video
   - Subscribe button
   - Playlist for binge-watching

3. **Verbal CTA**
   - "Click here to watch my full tutorial"
   - Point to where card appears

**Result:** 40-60% of viewers watch another video (vs. 10-15% without optimization)
