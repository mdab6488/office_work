### YouTube Analytics

Data-driven decisions separate growing channels from stagnant ones.

#### Key Metrics to Track

**1. Watch Time (Most Important)**

```
Total Watch Time = Total minutes viewers spent watching
Goal: Increase month-over-month

Why It Matters:
- Primary ranking factor for YouTube algorithm
- More watch time = more recommendations
- Indicates content quality
```

**Real-Life Benchmark:**
- **Good**: 40%+ average view duration
- **Great**: 50%+ average view duration
- **Excellent**: 60%+ average view duration

**2. Click-Through Rate (CTR)**

```
CTR = (Impressions that became views / Total impressions) × 100

Example: 10,000 impressions, 800 clicks = 8% CTR
```

**Real-Life Benchmarks:**

| CTR Range | Performance |
|-----------|-------------|
| 2-3% | Poor (needs improvement) |
| 4-5% | Average |
| 6-8% | Good |
| 9-12% | Great |
| 13%+ | Excellent |

**How to Improve CTR:**
- Better thumbnails
- More compelling titles
- A/B testing

**3. Average View Duration (AVD)**

```
AVD = Total Watch Time / Total Views

Example: 
Video Length: 10 minutes
AVD: 6 minutes
Retention Rate: 60%
```

**Strategies to Increase AVD:**

```
✅ Strong hook in first 10 seconds
✅ Pattern interrupts every 30-60 seconds
✅ Trim unnecessary content
✅ Use jump cuts
✅ Add B-roll footage
✅ Create curiosity loops
✅ Deliver on title promise early
```

**4. Traffic Sources**

**Real-Life Distribution (Healthy Channel):**

```
YouTube Search: 20-30%
Suggested Videos: 40-50%
Browse Features: 10-15%
External: 5-10%
Direct/Unknown: 5-10%
```

**What Each Means:**

- **YouTube Search**: Strong SEO, title/tags working
- **Suggested Videos**: Algorithm loves your content
- **Browse**: Channel homepage, subscriptions feed
- **External**: Social media, websites, embeds
- **Direct**: People typing URL or using saved links

**5. Audience Retention Graph**

**Example Analysis:**

```
0-10 sec:  100% (everyone starts)
10-30 sec:  85% (lost 15% - weak hook)
30-60 sec:  75% (lost 10% - intro too long)
1-2 min:    65% (lost 10% - normal drop)
2-5 min:    55% (steady watching)
5-6 min:    45% (spike drop - boring section)
6-10 min:   40% (stayed to end - good!)
```

**How to Read:**
- **Sharp drops** = boring content, fix those sections
- **Spikes up** = rewatching, great content
- **Steady decline** = normal, okay if gradual
- **End spike** = viewers jumping to end (clickbait?)

#### YouTube Studio Dashboard Tour

**Real-Life Priority Workflow:**

**Daily (5 minutes):**
```
1. Check "Reach" tab

   - Views vs. impressions

2. Check "Engagement" tab

   - Average view duration
   - Likes/comments (respond to comments)
```

**Weekly (20 minutes):**
```

   - Which playlists keep viewers watching?
   - Optimize low-performers

3. Revenue (if monetized)

4. Competitive Analysis
   - How do your metrics compare?
   - What can you learn?
```

#### Advanced Analytics

**Real-Life Example: Graham Stephan (Finance)**

**His Analysis Process:**

1. **Thumbnail Testing**
   ```
   - Tracks CTR for each thumbnail version
   - Changes thumbnail if CTR drops below 8%
   - Result: Maintains 10-12% average CTR
   ```

2. **Audience Retention Study**
   ```
   - Found viewers drop off at 8-minute mark
   - Started making videos 7-8 minutes
   - Result: Improved AVD from 4:30 to 5:45
   ```

3. **Upload Time Optimization**
   ```
   - Tested different upload times
   - Found his audience most active at 11 AM PST
   - Result: 30% higher CTR in first hour
   ```
