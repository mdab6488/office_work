### What is Structured Data

**Definition:**

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying its content. It helps search engines understand what your content means, not just what it says.

**Analogy:**

Think of structured data as nutrition labels on food products. Without the label, you can see it's cereal, but the label tells you exactly: 250 calories, 10g protein, 45g carbs, etc. Structured data does the same for web content.

**Why It Matters for SEO:**

1. **Rich Snippets**: Stand out in search results with stars, prices, images
2. **Knowledge Panels**: Get featured in Google's Knowledge Graph
3. **Voice Search**: Helps virtual assistants understand and cite your content
4. **Click-Through Rate**: Rich results get 30% more clicks on average
5. **Featured Snippets**: Increased chance of position zero

**Real-Life Impact:**
